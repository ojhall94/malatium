\textbf{Studies using asteroseismic ages and rotation rates from star-spot rotation have indicated that standard age-rotation relations may break down roughly half-way through the main sequence lifetime, a phenomenon referred to as weakened magnetic braking. While rotation rates from spots can be difficult to determine for older, less active stars, rotational splitting of asteroseismic oscillation frequencies can provide rotation rates for both active and quiescent stars, and so can confirm whether this effect really takes place on the main sequence.\\
We obtained asteroseismic rotation rates of 91 main sequence stars showing high signal-to-noise modes of oscillation.
Using these new rotation rates, along with effective temperatures, metallicities and seismic masses and ages, we built a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to determine whether the ensemble more closely agreed with a standard rotational evolution scenario \cite{vansaders+pinsonneault2013}, or one where weakened magnetic braking takes place \cite{vansaders+2016}. The weakened magnetic braking scenario was found to be $98.4\%$ more likely for our stellar ensemble, adding to the growing body of evidence for this stage of stellar rotational evolution. This work represents the largest catalogue of seismic rotation on the main sequence to date, opening up possibilities for more detailed ensemble analysis of rotational evolution with \textit{Kepler}.}

Gyrochronology is the study of the relationship between a star's rotation period and its age. As a star grows older along the main sequence, magnetic winds will cause it to lose angular momentum, slowing its rotation. Because the loss rate is related to temperature, the rotation period of a young star will rapidly settle on to a plane in age-colour-rotation space \cite{barnes2007}. As a result, knowing the rotation and colour of a star provides an avenue to measure its age, to a precision of $\sim 10\%$ for stars most similar to the Sun \cite{meibom+2015}. Age can otherwise be difficult to infer, and so gyrochronology enables more in-depth studies of stellar populations and individual stars \cite{leiner+2019,claytor+2019}.

Gyrochronology was previously calibrated on stellar clusters, which have well constrained ages, but only up to roughly $4\, \rm{Gyr}$ \cite{meibom+2015, barnes+2016}. With the launch of the \textit{Kepler} mission \cite{borucki+2010}, ages of main sequence field stars (i.e. not in clusters) became more widely available through asteroseismology, the study of stellar variability \cite{silvaaguirre+2015}. When looking at these stars, disagreements were found between the observations and gyrochronology beyond the middle of stars' main sequence lifetimes, which could not be reconciled with existing theories \cite{angus+2015, nielsen+2015, davies+2015}. It was proposed that at some stage in a star's evolution it undergoes \textit{weakened magnetic braking} (WMB, \cite{vansaders+2016}), where the efficiency of angular momentum loss rapidly drops. This would cause stars to maintain relatively fast rotation rates at old ages, which we would not expect from the extrapolation of existing gyrochronology relations.

The mechanism by which weakened magnetic braking occurs has since been the subject of ongoing debate, and may be connected to changes in the magnetic field morphology \cite{vansaders+2016,reville+2015,garraffo+2016, metcalfe+2016, metcalfe+2019, see+2019}. It may also be explained from an observational point of view. A large scale survey of stellar rotation rates measured using star-spots pointed out a lack of slowly rotating stars older then Sun \cite{mcquillan+2014}. As activity reduces with age, older stars with fewer star-spots are less likely to have their rotation measured \cite{matt+2015, reinhold+2020}. The point at which the detection probability drops appears to lie at a similar level of activity as the expected onset of weakened magnetic braking, pitting these two possibilities against one another \cite{vansaders+2019}.

Determining whether weakened magnetic braking is a true phenomenon or a bias in star-spot observations requires new measurements of rotation in quiescent stars, which can be provided by asteroseismology. A star's rotation causes modes of oscillation to split into multiplets, making it possible to obtain an independent rate of rotation by measuring the splitting between oscillation frequencies \cite{ledoux1951}. Asteroseismic rotation requires a faster observing cadence and higher signal-to-noise than than spot rotation, but does not require spots to be visible, meaning that we can measure rotation for older, quiescent stars that would not have been present in existing rotation catalogues. This makes asteroseismic rotation rates a perfect test of weakened magnetic braking on the main sequence. Here, we measured asteroseismic rotation rates of 91 main sequence stars across a broad range of  ages, and evaluated this new ensemble to determine whether it agrees more closely with a classical rotational evolution scenario, or one in which weakened magnetic braking takes place.\\

\textbf{Asteroseismic main sequence targets:} In order to obtain robust asteroseismic rotation rates, we required detections of multiples of both dipole (denoted as $\ell = 1$) and quadrupole ($\ell = 2$) p mode\footnote{\textit{Pressure} modes, the type of oscillation visible in main sequence stars.} oscillations for each star, of which the latter have significantly lower signal-to noise. Radial oscillations ($\ell = 0$) are also visible, but do not split. In this work, we studied a sample of 95 of the highest signal-to-noise targets observed by \textit{Kepler}, combining the `Kages' \cite{silvaaguirre+2015,davies+2016} and LEGACY \cite{lund+2017, silvaaguirre+2017} catalogues\footnote{For these catalogues the mode extraction through frequency fitting \cite{davies+2016, lund+2017} and modelling using mode frequencies to obtain stellar parameters \cite{silvaaguirre+2015, silvaaguirre+2017} are covered in separate papers.}. Further details on these data can be found in \textbf{Methods}. 

We separated our sample into three categories \cite{garcia+2014}: 64 main sequence stars (MS, $\rm{log(g)} > 4.0\, \rm dex$, $T_{\rm eff} < 6250\, \rm K$); 4 potential sub-giant stars (SG, $\rm{log(g)} < 4.0\, \rm dex$, $T_{\rm eff} < 6250\, \rm K$), which may have begun to evolve off the main sequence, complicating their rotational history\footnote{It should be noted that none of these stars have identified mixed dipole modes, which indicate an evolved structure (see \cite{bedding+2010}).}; and 24 `hot' stars (H, $T_{\rm eff} > 6250\, \rm K$), which lie above the Kraft break, the point at which convective envelopes are thin, and angular momentum loss through magnetic winds becomes inefficient \cite{kraft1967}. Our conclusions are largely insensitive to these categorical assignments, and they are intended solely to help explore results category-by-category. The sample, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sample}, spans surface gravities of $3.8\, \rm{dex} < \rm{log(g)} < 4.6\, \rm{dex}$, temperatures of $5000\, \textrm{K} < T_{\rm eff} <  6700\, \rm{K}$, and ages from $1$ to $\sim 13\, \rm{Gyr}$.\\

\end{figure}


\textbf{Results of asteroseismic fitting:} The stars in `Kages' and LEGACY which form our stellar sample have been subject to detailed asteroseismic frequency fitting in the catalogue papers, but did not have reported asteroseismic rotation. Here, we repeated the mode frequency fitting with a Bayesian model that accounted for rotation in more detail, and improved the treatment of existing asteroseismic relations in frequency fitting techniques (see \textbf{Methods} and \textbf{Supplementary Information}). We fit our new model to \kepler power-spectra of 95 stars, which was successful in 94 cases. We report summary statistics used throughout the rest of this paper as the median of the posterior distribution on the model parameters, with the uncertainties being the $15.9^{\rm th}$ and $84.1^{\rm st}$ percentiles, meaning that some reported parameters (such as period) have asymmetric uncertainties.

We compared our results with both published and unpublished asteroseismic rotation rates \cite{nielsen+2015,davies+2015,davies+2016, lund+2017, benomar+2018}, and found that the three stars with the lowest angles of inclination ($< 10^\circ$) were inconsistent with multiple other studies. To some degree this was expected, as  for stars viewed near pole-on the split modes of oscillation have extremely low power, making them hard to detect reliably. We flagged our rotation rates for these stars, and did not use them in the next steps in our analysis, leaving a sample of 91 stars for which we considered our asteroseismic rotation measurements to be robust (for a full justification, see \textbf{Methods}).\\

\textbf{Seismic versus surface rotation rates:} Different methods of rotation measurement probe different depths of stars. Asteroseismology of main sequence stars probes internal rotation in the near surface layers, where the observed modes of oscillation are most sensitive \cite{lund+2014}. Measurements of star-spot modulation instead probe the rotation rates of star-spots on the surface, at active latitudes. Previous studies have shown that seismic rotation rates show no statistically significant deviation from spot rotation rates \cite{nielsen+2015, benomar+2015}. We confirm that this holds true for our larger sample, in order to ensure that our seismic rotation periods can be reliably used to draw conclusions on the evolution of surface rotation.

Figure \ref{fig:protlit} shows a comparison between 48 stars from our sample for which spot  rotation rates had previously been measured. Rotation rates from spot modulation are subject to measuring multiples of the true rotation rate, and also sometimes over-correct for this effect. This is not the case for asteroseismic rotation, and so some stars may appear at the 2:1 and 1:2 lines in the figure. We fit a line of the form $P_{\rm surf} = m \times P_{\rm seis}$, using the larger of the asymmetrical uncertainties on asteroseismic rotation, and excluding stars above the 1.8:1 line to avoid likely multiples of the true rotation rate acting as outliers (transparent in the Figure). Our fit found a value of $m = 0.96 \pm 0.03$, showing a close agreement ($<2\sigma$) between asteroseismic and surface rotation rates on a population level. 
%Of the stars used in this comparison, 21 had a median value of $P_{\rm s}$ in the gyrochronology analysis. We repeated the model fit for these stars only, and found a value of $m = 0.96 \pm 0.04$.  
This overall agreement between spot and seismic rotation rates is in line with previous studies of Sun-like stars \cite{nielsen+2015, benomar+2015, gizon+2013, chaplin+2013}, and so we concluded that our asteroseismic ensemble can be reliably used to draw inferences about gyrochronology.\\

\end{figure}

\textbf{Comparing gyrochronology models:} To evaluate the implications of our seismic ensemble for gyrochronology, we compared our new asteroseismic rotation rates to two population models of rotational evolution \cite{vansaders+2019}: a `standard' model, which assumes a traditional angular momentum transport through magnetically driven stellar winds \cite{vansaders+2016,skumanich1972, kawaler1988}, and one where weakened magnetic braking takes place (hereafter the `WMB model') \cite{vansaders+2016}  The WMB model was identical to the standard model in its input physics, except for the condition that angular momentum loss ceases above a critical Rossby number of $Ro_{\rm crit} = 1.97$\footnote{The Rossby number may be defined as $Ro \equiv P/\tau_{\rm cz}$, where $\tau_{\rm cz}$ is the convective turnover timescale, and $P$ is the rotation. The Rossby number roughly scales inversely with stellar activity (and so increases as stars age).}.

Instead of comparing our rotation rates directly to models of individual stars, we instead compared them to synthetic TRILEGAL populations based on what the \textit{Kepler} field would look like under these two different braking laws \cite{vansaders+2019, girardi+2012}. These synthetic populations were then altered to match the distribution of existing catalogues of stars in the \kepler field in order to replicate the \kepler selection effects \cite{berger+2020}, and evolved following a standard or WMB braking law. For the full details on how these models were constructed, see \textbf{Methods}.

In order to ensure our results were based on the most robust rotation measurements, we focused on the stars with the best convergence metrics in the mode frequency fitting, excluding those with a number of effective samples $n_{\rm eff} < 1000$ and a Gelman-Rubin metric of $\hat{R}>1.1$ \cite{gelman+rubin1992,salvatier+2016} (see \textbf{Extended Data} Table \ref{tab:results}). Two stars with low metallicities ($< -0.8\, \rm {dex}$) that fell outside the boundaries of our stellar models were also excluded. The remaining sample of 73 stars contained 4 potential sub-giants, 22 `hot' stars and 47 main sequence stars. Figure \ref{fig:fullsample} shows these stars plotted over the top of both the standard and WMB population models in rotation-temperature space, alongside the stars not used in the gyrochronology analysis (shown without uncertainties).

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fullsample.png}
	\caption{Stars for which rotation was measured in this work, plotted over TRILEGAL \cite{girardi+2012} stellar population models evolved under standard (top) and weakened magnetic braking (WMB, bottom) prescriptions of angular momentum evolution. The 21 stars that were excluded from the gyrochronology analysis are marked with crosses and without uncertainties (see text). Circles, squares and triangles denote main sequence, sub-giant, and `hot' stars respectively. Stars with a metallicity of $\bigl\lvert \feh \bigl\rvert > 0.4$ are shown in purple, to indicate that they fall outside the functional range of the stellar models  \cite{vansaders+2019}. Note that this figure shows the projection of a 5-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional representation, as only period-temperature space is shown here. When evaluating between the two model prescriptions we also considered mass, age and metallicity. The errorbars on the asteroseismic rotation represent the $15.9^{\rm th}$ and $84.1^{\rm st}$ percentiles on the measured posterior distributions.}
	\label{fig:fullsample}
\end{figure*}

We evaluated our ensemble against both population models simultaneously using a Bayesian mixture model, which treated the data as being drawn from a mixture made from Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) of both populations, modulated by a mixing parameter $P_{\rm s}$. In the limit that $P_{\rm s} \rightarrow 1$, the data are most likely drawn from the standard model. In the limit $P_{\rm s} \rightarrow 0$, the WMB model is more likely. This mixture model was evaluated in a five-dimensional parameter space, accounting for the population distributions in effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), metallicity (\feh), asteroseismic mass ($M$) and age ($t$) and our new rotation periods ($P$). For further detail, see \textbf{Methods}.\\

\textbf{Results of comparing models:} We fit our mixture model to each star individually, which yielded a posterior probability density for the value of $P_{\rm s}$ for that star. In order to assess the posterior probability for the full sample, we multiplied the individual posterior probabilities for $P_{\rm{s}}$. This was done for the full ensemble of 73 stars together, as well as for the three different stellar types separately. These joint probabilities can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:gyroresults} in the left-hand plot. The cumulative probabilities can be seen in the right-hand plot. In both of these plots, the left-hand side holds 98.4\% of the probability, indicating that the weakened magnetic braking model is preferred. When only considering the 47 main sequence stars, for which braking models are best calibrated, this rises to 99.2\%. 

Both hot and sub-giant stars do not strongly prefer one model over the other (both crossing the $P_{\rm{s}} = 0.5$ line at roughly $45\%$), which is expected given that these stars in our sample all lie at hot temperatures near the Kraft break. When performing this analysis on all 89 stars for which seismic rotation was measured (excluding the two stars with low metallicity), this the total probability below $P_{\rm{s}} = 0.5$ is 96.6\%. \\

	\label{fig:gyroresults}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Verifying consequences for gyrochronology:} In order to verify that our results presented a meaningful confirmation of weakened magnetic braking, we ensured that the same results were obtained when using different subsets of the ensemble, and when exploring potential biases. We found that the joint posterior distribution did not change significantly when excluding stars with metallicities that fell only slightly outside the model range, or those with extremely small uncertainties on asteroseismic mass (see \textbf{Methods}). Stars in our sample with known binary companions that may disrupt their rotational evolution were not found to contribute strongly to the joint posterior probability of $P_{\rm s}$. 

We checked that our results remained the same if the `Kages' and LEGACY catalogues had underestimated the uncertainties on the asteroseismic mass and age, which form part of our mixture model analysis. We reran our analysis after inflating the uncertainties on these properties to align with the expected systematic uncertainty from stellar models \cite{silvaaguirre+2015,silvaaguirre+2017}. The results from this echoed what we found for the unaltered ensemble. We also accounted for the possibility that asteroseismic methods systematically overestimated stellar age, and reran our analysis after shifting the seismic ages younger by their systematic uncertainty ($6-8\%$). This resulted in $95.8\%$ of the posterior probability to lie below $P_{\rm s} = 0.5$, compared to $98.4\%$ for the unaltered ensemble. From this, we can infer that our conclusions are robust against potential issues in seismic analyses. For a full discussion of these tests and other biases, see \textbf{Methods}.\\

Weakened magnetic braking was first proposed by van Saders et al. (2016) \cite[hereafter the `van Saders' study]{vansaders+2016} in response to stars with spot rotation rates faster than expected from gyrochronology at their asteroseismic ages. This discrepancy was also indicated at around the same time in other studies of asteroseismic ages of main sequence stars \cite{angus+2015, nielsen+2015,  davies+2015}. The theory of weakened magnetic braking has been both reinforced by recent studies \cite{metcalfe+egeland2019}, as well as disputed \cite{lorenzo-oliveira+2019}, at least at the critical Rossby number originally proposed.

A recent study using spectroscopic rotation measurements of 14 solar twins, compared to grids of stellar models, found marginal evidence favouring a standard rotational evolution \cite{lorenzo-oliveira+2019}. If weakened magnetic braking were to take place, this work proposed that it would most likely be outside the range of their sample, at $Ro_{\rm {crit}} \geq 2.29$, compared to the value of $1.97$ used in this work. Our sample does not overlap with theirs, so we can not directly compare to their results. Our work does find statistical agreement with a model of weakened magnetic braking at a critical Rossby number of $1.97$ over one without any braking at all, indicating that traces of weakened magnetic braking do occur at Rossby numbers of around $2$. A comparison to models of different Rossby numbers will be explored in future papers, using the LEGACY and `Kages' rotation sample presented in this work.

As a sanity check that the evidence in favour of weakened magnetic braking presented in this work is independently robust, we recreated the joint posterior probability for $P_{\rm s}$, this time looking only at MS stars, and excluding any of the 22 stars that were included in the original van Saders study used to detect weakened magnetic braking. Of the 47 MS stars used to distinguish between stellar models, 16 were included in the van Saders sample. Both the 16 stars in the original van Saders study as well as the remaining MS stars favoured the WMB model, although the van Saders stars did so more strongly, not including any stars that favoured the standard model. Specifically, when considering only the van Saders stars, $96.3\%$ of the total joint probability lay below $P_{\rm s} = 0.5$, compared to $91.7\%$ when considering only those stars \emph{not} included in the van Saders study. The stars initially used to propose the WMB model are still those most strongly in favour of it even when using asteroseismic rotation rates only, a result which is now further reinforced by an expanded sample that includes quiescent stars.\\


\textbf{Conclusions:} In this work, we obtained asteroseismic rotation rates for 91 stars using a hierarchical Bayesian model to fit for oscillation frequencies, convective background, and rotational splitting simultaneously. We validated these results against previously published and unpublished asteroseismic rotation measurements, making our new rotation catalogue the largest self-consistent sample of asteroseismic rotation in main sequence stars to date. We evaluated the stars in our sample against synthetic population models of the \textit{Kepler} field evolved under either a `standard' model of rotational evolution, or one where weakened magnetic braking takes place. This evaluation was done using a Bayesian mixture model to determine whether the ensemble preferred one model over another, and was done simultaneously in asteroseismic rotation, mass, age, and spectroscopic temperature and metallicity.\\

We leave the reader with the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We found that our ensemble was $98.4\%$ more likely to be drawn from a weakened magnetic braking model than a standard model of rotational evolution \cite{vansaders+pinsonneault2013}, at a critical Rossby number of $Ro_{\rm{crit}} = 1.97$. This work expands upon previous analysis \cite{vansaders+2019} by including quiescent stars older than the Sun. This conclusion was found to be robust against change of ensemble members and potentially underestimated asteroseismic systematic uncertainties. A comparison to other braking laws \cite{matt+2015} and other gyrochronology relations \cite{barnes2010} using our asteroseismic ensemble will take place in future work.
	
	\item We compared our new asteroseismic rotation rates with surface rotation measures from spot modulation. Our findings replicate those in similar studies \cite{nielsen+2015,benomar+2015}, in the sense that we find no statistically significant difference between seismic and spot modulation measures of stellar rotation in our ensemble.
	
	\item The new asteroseismic rotation catalogue presented in this work will act as an entry point for more detailed studies, including comparisons between different braking laws and individually modeled values of stellar rotation at different critical Rossby numbers.
	
%	\item We present new techniques for asteroseismic `peak-bagging' frequency analyses, specifically: expressing well known empirical asteroseismic relations in a hierarchical modeling structure to account for small-scale effects not included in our model (such as acoustic glitches), and replacing uninformative empirical relations with Gaussian Process priors, detailed in the \textbf{Supplementary Information}.
	
\end{enumerate}

In the near future our new asteroseismic rotation catalogue will be further complemented with high-precision surface rotation measurements, activity indicators and atmospheric parameters from spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST \cite{deng+2012}, 4MOST \cite{dejong+2014}, WEAVE \cite{dalton+2014} and SDSS-V \cite{blanton+2019, kollmeier+2019}, and new asteroseismic measurements of age from the \ktwo and \tess missions. With these surveys, large scale ensemble asteroseismology will continue to increase the possibilities for understanding gyrochronology.\\
