Asteroseismology based on high-precision uninterrupted space photometry has become a new way to test the outcome of stellar evolution theory and was recently applied to a multitude of stars, but not yet to massive evolved supergiants.Our aim is to detect, analyse and interpret the photospheric and wind variability of the O9.5Iab star HD 188209 from Kepler space photometry and long-term high-resolution spectroscopy. We used Kepler scattered-light photometry obtained by the nominal mission during 1460d to deduce the photometric variability of this O-type supergiant. In addition, we assembled and analysed high-resolution high signal-to-noise spectroscopy taken with four spectrographs during some 1800d to interpret the temporal spectroscopic variability of the star. The variability of this blue supergiant derived from the scattered-light space photometry is in full in agreement with the one found in the ground-based spectroscopy. We find significant low-frequency variability that is consistently detected in all spectral lines of HD 188209. The photospheric variability propagates into the wind, where it has similar frequencies but slightly higher amplitudes. The morphology of the frequency spectra derived from the long-term photometry and spectroscopy points towards a spectrum of travelling waves with frequency values in the range expected for an evolved O-type star. Convectively-driven internal gravity waves excited in the stellar interior offer the most plausible explanation of the detected variability.},

  abstract = {Transiting exoplanets in multi-planet systems have non-Keplerian orbits which can cause the times and durations of transits to vary. The theory and observations of transit timing variations (TTV) and transit duration variations (TDV) are reviewed. A watershed since the last review is that the Kepler spacecraft has detected several hundred perturbed planets. In a few cases, these data have been used to discover additional planets, which has historical resonance with how Neptune was discovered in our own Solar System. However, the more impactful aspect of TTV and TDV studies has been characterization of planetary systems in which multiple planets transit. After addressing the equations of motion and parameter scalings, the main dynamical mechanisms for TTV and TDV are described, with citations to the observational literature for real examples. We describe parameter constraints, particularly how the mass/eccentricity degeneracy comes about and is overcome by the high-frequency component of the signal. On the observational side, derivation of timing precision and introduction to the timing diagram are given. Science results are reviewed, with an emphasis on mass measurements of transiting sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, which allows access to the mass-radius diagram and hence inference of bulk compositions.},

However, the data processing is made more challenging by the reduced pointing accuracy of the satellite, which has only two functioning reaction wheels. We present a new method to extract precise light curves from K2 data, combining list-driven, soft-edged aperture photometry with a star-by-star correction of systematic effects associated with the drift in the roll-angle of the satellite about its boresight. The systematics are modelled simultaneously with the stars' intrinsic variability using a semi-parametric Gaussian process model. We test this method on a week of data collected during an engineering test in January 2014, perform checks to verify that our method does not alter intrinsic variability signals, and compute the precision as a function of magnitude on long-cadence (30-min) and planetary transit (2.5-hour) timescales. In both cases, we reach photometric precisions close to the precision reached during the nominal Kepler mission for stars fainter than 12th magnitude, and between 40 and 80 parts per million for brighter stars. These results confirm the bright prospects for planet detection and characterisation, asteroseismology and stellar variability studies with K2. Finally, we perform a basic transit search on the light curves, detecting 2 bona fide transit-like events, 7 detached eclipsing binaries and 13 classical variables.},

  abstract = {We pose the question of how much information on the atmospheric parameters of late-type stars can be retrieved purely from colors using standard photometric systems. We carried out numerical experiments using stellar fluxes from model atmospheres, injecting random noise before analyzing them. We examined the presence of degeneracies among
atmospheric parameters, and evaluated how well the parameters are extracted depending on the number and wavelength span of the photometric filters available, from the UV GALEX to the mid-IR WISE passbands. We also considered spectrophotometry from the Gaia mission. We find that stellar effective temperatures can be determined accurately (\$\textbackslash sigma \textbackslash sim\$ 0.01 dex or about 150 K) when reddening is negligible or known, based merely on optical photometry, and the accuracy can be improved twofold by including IR data. On the other hand, stellar metallicities and surface gravities are fairly unconstrained from optical or IR photometryy. However, our ability to retrieve these parameters can improve significantly by adding UV photometry. When reddening is considered a free parameter, assuming it can be modeled perfectly, our experiments suggest that it can be disentangled from the rest of the parameters. This theoretical study indicates that combining broad-band photometry from the UV to the mid-IR allows atmospheric parameters and interstellar extinction to be determined with fair accuracy. The use of UV passbands helps substantially to derive metallicities and surface gravities, as well as to break the degeneracy between effective
temperature and reddening. The Gaia BP/RP data can disentangle all the parameters, provided the stellar SEDs are modeled reasonably well.},

  abstract = {The average near-infrared (K-band) luminosity of 238 Hipparcos red clump giants is derived and then used to measure the distance to the Galactic center. These Hipparcos red clump giants have been previously employed as I-band standard candles. The advantage of the K-band is a decreased sensitivity to reddening and perhaps a reduced systematic dependence on metallicity. In order to investigate the latter, and also to refer our calibration to a known metallicity zero point, we restrict our sample of red clump calibrators to those with abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopic data. The mean metallicity of the sample is [Fe/H]=-0.18 dex ({$\sigma$}=0.17 dex). The data are consistent with no correlation between M\textsubscript{K} and [Fe/H] and only weakly constrain the slope of this relation. The luminosity function of the sample peaks at M\textsubscript{K}=-1.61+/-0.03 mag. Next, we assemble published optical and near-infrared photometry for \textasciitilde 20 red clump giants in a Baade's window field with a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-0.17+/-0.09 dex, which is nearly identical to that of the Hipparcos red clump. Assuming that the average (V-I)\textsubscript{0} and (V-K)\textsubscript{0} colors of these two red clumps are the same, the extinctions in the Baade's window field are found to be A\textsubscript{V}=1.56, A\textsubscript{I}=0.87, and A\textsubscript{K}=0.15, in agreement with previous estimates. We derive the distance to the Galactic center: (m-M)\textsubscript{0}=14.58+/-0.11 mag, or R=8.24+/-0.42 kpc. The uncertainty in this distance measurement is dominated by the small number of Baade's window red clump giants examined here.},

  abstract = {The rotation rates and magnetic activity of Sun-like and low-mass ( 1.4M ) main-sequence stars are known to decline with time, and there now exist several models for the evolution of rotation and activity. However, the role that chemical composition plays during stellar spin-down has not yet been explored. In this work, we use a structural evolution code to compute the rotational evolution of stars with three different masses (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 M ) and six different metallicities, ranging from [Fe/H] = -1.0 to [Fe/H] = +0.5. We also implement three different wind-braking formulations from the literature (two modern and one classical) and compare their predictions for rotational evolution. The effect that metallicity has on stellar structural properties, and in particular the convective turnover timescale, leads the two modern wind-braking formulations to predict a strong dependence of the torque on metallicity. Consequently, they predict that metal rich stars spin-down more effectively at late ages ( 1 Gyr) than metal poor stars, and the effect is large enough to be detectable with current observing facilities. For example, the formulations predict that a Sun-like (solar-mass and solar-aged) star with [Fe/H] = -0.3 will have a rotation period of less than 20 days. Even though old, metal poor stars are predicted to rotate more rapidly at a given age, they have larger Rossby numbers and are thus expected to have lower magnetic activity levels. Finally, the different wind-braking formulations predict quantitative differences in the metallicity-dependence of stellar rotation, which may be used to test them.},

  abstract = {Young and active stars generally have regular, almost sinusoidal, patterns of variability attributed to their rotation, while the majority of older and less active stars, including the Sun, have more complex and non-regular light-curves which do not have clear rotational-modulation signals. Consequently, the rotation periods have been successfully determined only for a small fraction of the Sun-like stars observed by transit-based planet-hunting missions, such as CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS. This suggests that only a small fraction of such systems have been properly identified as solar-like analogs. We apply a new method for determining rotation periods of low-activity stars, like the Sun. The method is based on calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) of stellar brightness variations and identifying a tell-tale inflection point in the spectrum. The rotation frequency is then proportional to the frequency of that inflection point. In this paper test this GPS method against available photometric records of the Sun. We apply GPS, autocorrelation functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and wavelet analyses to the total solar irradiance (TSI) time series obtained from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on the Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and the Variability of solar IRradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) experiment on the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) missions. We analyse the performance of all methods at various levels of solar activity. We show that the GPS method returns accurate values of solar rotation independently of the level of solar activity. In particular, it performs well during periods of high solar activity, when TSI variability displays an irregular pattern and other methods fail. Our results suggest that the GPS method can successfully determine the rotational periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light-curves.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the space missions CoRoT and Kepler, it has recently become feasible to determine precise asteroseismic masses and relative ages for large samples of red giant stars. We present the CoRoGEE dataset, obtained from CoRoT light curves for 606 red giants in two fields of the Galactic disc that have been co-observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We used the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances, extinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis, resulting in relative statistical uncertainties of {$\lessequivlnt$}2\% in distance, 4\% in radius, 9\% in mass and 25\% in age. We also assessed systematic age uncertainties stemming from different input physics and mass loss. We discuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field stars over a broad radial range of the Milky Way disc (5 kpc \&lt;R\textsubscript{Gal}\&lt; 14 kpc), focussing on the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of the Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of pure chemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available, especially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a significant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the solar neighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a chemodynamical Milky Way disc model indicate that the number of high-metallicity stars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong radial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also show that the age distribution of the [{$\alpha$}/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE inner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial mixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick-disc/bulge component that formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies. Our results are subject to future improvements due to (a) the still low statistics, because our sample had to be sliced into bins of Galactocentric distances and ages; (b) large uncertainties in proper motions (and therefore guiding radii); and (c) corrections to the asteroseismic mass-scaling relation. The situation will improve not only upon the upcoming Gaia data releases, but also with the foreseen increase in the number of stars with both seismic and spectroscopic information.

This paper describes a maximum-likelihood method for estimating the model parameters (based on the observed power spectrum statistics) that accounts for redistribution of spectral power caused by gaps in the data string, by convolving the model with the power spectrum of the observed window function. The accuracy and reliability of the method were tested using both artificial and authentic solar oscillation power spectrum data. A comparison of this method with various least-squares techniques is also presented.},

  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multi-band photometry exists for a large fraction of the \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{Gaia\}\} \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here we use \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{2MASS\}\} colors for 1.4 million \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color--magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way, but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (\textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{XD\}\}) algorithm---an Empirical Bayes approximation to a full hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star---to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} likelihood to infer a precise photometric parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and are more precise than previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} parallax estimates, but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior pdf for each of 1.4 million \textbackslash textsl\{\textbackslash small\{TGAS\}\} stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously Corsaro et al. 2015, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

  abstract = {Among the available methods for dating stars, gyrochronology is a powerful one because it requires knowledge of only the star's mass and rotation period. Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters, with the Sun providing the only age dependence, and are therefore poorly calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the form P = A\textsuperscript{n} \texttimes{} (B - V - c)\textsuperscript{b}, where P is rotation period in days, A is age in Myr, B and V are magnitudes and a, b and n are the free parameters of our model. We found a = 0.40\^\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.05\}, b = 0.31\^\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.02\} and n = 0.55\^\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.09\}. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology parameters and we carefully checked the effects of leaving out parts of our sample, leading us to find that no single relation between rotation period, colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars may be subject to observational biases; however, the clusters show unexpected deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method.},

Systematics affecting K2 light curves due to the decreased spacecraft pointing precision inhibit the easy extraction of periodic signals from the data. We here develop a method for producing periodograms of K2 light curves that are insensitive to pointing-induced systematics; the Systematics-Insensitive Periodogram (SIP). Traditional sine-fitting periodograms use a generative model to find the frequency of a sinusoid that best describes the data. We extend this principle by including systematic trends, based on a set of 'Eigen light curves', following Foreman-Mackey et al. (2015), in our generative model as well as a sum of sine and cosine functions over a grid of frequencies. Using this method we are able to produce periodograms with vastly reduced systematic features. The quality of the resulting periodograms are such that we can recover acoustic oscillations in giant stars and measure stellar rotation periods without the need for any detrending. The algorithm is also applicable to the detection of other periodic phenomena such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries and short-period exoplanet candidates. The SIP code is available at https://github.com/RuthAngus/SIPK2.},

  abstract = {Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic - spots move on the stellar surface and have finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces have many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate effective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel function. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalizing over the other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test the effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces periods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these and many more, altogether 1102 Kepler objects of interest, and their posterior probability density function samples. Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in exoplanet systems, or characterizing star-planet interactions. The code used to implement this method is available online.},

We show that incorporating rotation periods into stellar evolution models significantly improves the precision of inferred ages. Since ages predicted with gyrochronology can, in general, be much more precise than isochronal ages, care must be taken to ensure that the gyrochronology model being used is accurate.

Additional targets with photometric rotation periods and precise ages are needed to resolve the tension between gyrochronology and asteroseismology. K2 and TESS will provide rotation periods and asteroseismic ages for hundreds of stars, some of which will lie in clusters. Both of these surveys will require sophisticated methods for photometry extraction, treatment of systematics and rotation period measurement.

 Methods: We used a time series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars observed were categorised in three groups: simple, F-like, and mixed-mode. The simple group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of the degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for which the modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree frequencies. Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We developed and describe a methodology for extracting a single set of mode frequencies from multiple sets derived by different methods and individual scientists.

of this paper is to reproduce these results on which the claims are

We also correlated the power spectrum with an asymptotic model of g-mode
frequencies in a similar manner to Fossat and Schmider (2018, A\&A,

pure noise and for the GOLF data. Results: We confirm the

conclusions. Their claims of detection of g modes cannot be confirmed

series, or photomultipliers. Other instrument such as GONG and BiSON do
not confirm their detection. We also confirm the analysis performed in
Fossat and Schmider (2018), but again draw different conclusions. For
GOLF, the correlation of the power spectrum with the asymptotic model of
g-mode frequencies for l = 1 and l = 2 show a high correlation at lag=0
and at lag corresponding to the rotational splitting {$\nu$}l,
but the same occurs for pure noise due to the large number of peaks
present in the model. In addition, other very different parameters
defining the asymptotic model also provide a high correlation at these
lags. We conclude that the detection performed in Fossat and Schmider
(2018) is an artefact of the methodology.},

The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy and precision of the various Gaia DR2 data. The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the Catalogue content to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis, and comparisons to external data or to models. Although the astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data are of unprecedented quality and quantity, it is shown that the data cannot be used without a dedicated attention to the limitations described here, in the Catalogue documentation and in accompanying papers.

We determine oscillation frequencies, frequency separations, period spacings of mixed modes and mode visibilities for eight cluster giants. The oscillation parameters show that these stars are helium-core-burning red giants. The eight stars form two groups with very different oscillation power spectra; the four stars with lowest Delta\_nu-values display rich sets of mixed l=1 modes, while this is not the case for the four stars with higher Delta\_nu. For the four stars with lowest Delta\_nu, we determine the asymptotic period spacing of the mixed modes, DeltaP, which together with the masses we derive for all eight stars suggest that they belong to the so-called secondary clump. Based on the global oscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling which indicate that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence and in the helium-burning phase for these \textasciitilde 2M\_sun stars. Finally, our results indicate less mode suppression than predicted by recent theories for magnetic suppression of certain oscillation modes in red giants.},

Each object is cross-matched against variable star related guest observer proposals to the K2 mission, which specifies the variable type in some cases. The detrended lightcurves are also compared to lightcurves currently publicly available. The resulting catalogue is made available online via the MAST archive at https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2varcat/, and gives the ID, type, period, semi-amplitude and range of the variation seen.

This is often performed by human `eyeballing', a time consuming and statistically awkward process. Here we present a new, fast machine learning technique to separate true planet signals from astrophysical false positives. We use Self Organising Maps (SOMs) to study the transit shapes of \textbackslash emph\{Kepler\} and \textbackslash emph\{K2\} known and candidate planets. We find that SOMs are capable of distinguishing known planets from known false positives with a success rate of 87.0\textbackslash\%, using the transit shape alone. Furthermore, they do not require any candidates to be dispositioned prior to use, meaning that they can be used early in a mission's lifetime. A method for classifying candidates using a SOM is developed, and applied to previously unclassified members of the \textbackslash emph\{Kepler\} KOI list as well as candidates from the \textbackslash emph\{K2\} mission. The method is extremely fast, taking minutes to run the entire KOI list on a typical laptop. We make \textbackslash texttt\{Python\} code for performing classifications publicly available, using either new SOMs or those created in this work. The SOM technique represents a novel method for ranking planetary candidate lists, and can be used both alone or as part of a larger autovetting code.},

The planets in our Solar System show a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, with stable wind patterns, changing storms, and evolving anomalies. Brown dwarfs also exhibit atmospheric variability. Such temporal variability in the atmosphere of a giant exoplanet has not to date been observed. HAT-P-7 b is an exoplanet with a known offset in the peak of its phase curve. Here we present variations in the peak offset ranging between -0.086+0.033-0.033 to 0.143+0.040-0.037 in phase, implying that the peak brightness repeatedly shifts from one side of the planet's substellar point to the other. The variability occurs on a timescale of tens to hundreds of days. These shifts in brightness are indicative of variability in the planet's atmosphere, and result from a changing balance of thermal emission and reflected flux from the planet's dayside. We suggest that variation in wind speed in the planetary atmosphere, leading to variable cloud coverage on the dayside and a changing energy balance, is capable of explaining the observed variation.},

As most stars in the Gaia catalog will have non-negligible fractional parallax errors, we must treat distance estimation as a constrained inference problem. Here we investigate the performance of various priors for estimating distances, using a simulated Gaia catalog of one billion stars. We use three minimalist, isotropic priors, as well an anisotropic prior derived from the observability of stars in a Milky Way model. The two priors that assume a uniform distribution of stars\textemdash either in distance or in space density\textemdash give poor results: The root mean square fractional distance error, \{f\}\textsubscript{\{rms\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}, grows far in excess of 100\% once the fractional parallax error, \{f\}\textsubscript{\{true\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}, is larger than 0.1. A prior assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with increasing distance performs well once its single parameter\textemdash the scale length\textemdash{} has been set to an appropriate value: \{f\}\textsubscript{\{rms\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} is roughly equal to \{f\}\textsubscript{\{true\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} for \{f\}\textsubscript{\{true\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\textbackslash lt 0.4, yet does not increase further as \{f\}\textsubscript{\{true\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} increases up to to 1.0. The Milky Way prior performs well except toward the Galactic center, due to a mismatch with the (simulated) data. Such mismatches will be inevitable (and remain unknown) in real applications, and can produce large errors. We therefore suggest adopting the simpler exponentially decreasing space density prior, which is also less time-consuming to compute. Including Gaia photometry improves the distance estimation significantly for both the Milky Way and exponentially decreasing space density prior, yet doing so requires additional assumptions about the physical nature of stars.},

We validate our results by comparing our distance estimates for 105 Cepheids which have more precise, independently estimated distances. For this sample we find that the Milky Way prior performs better (the rms of the scaled residuals is 0.40) than the exponentially decreasing space density prior (rms is 0.57), although for distances beyond 2 kpc the Milky Way prior performs worse, with a bias in the scaled residuals of -0.36 (versus -0.07 for the exponentially decreasing space density prior).

A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters.

Rather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this didactic article, I show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error is larger than about 20\%, which will be the case for about 80\% of stars in the Gaia catalogue. Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use of prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and performance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed uninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance estimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some distance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information one has available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the survey and the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases asymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates non-positive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.},

We investigate how much additional uncertainty is introduced to stellar model parameters by our uncertainty about the functional form of the surface effect. At the same time, we test whether any of the parametrizations is significantly better or worse at modelling observed subgiants and low-luminosity red giants. We model six stars observed by Kepler that show clear mixed modes. We fix the input physics of the stellar models and vary the choice of surface correction ... Models using a solar-calibrated power law correction consistently fit the observations more poorly than the other four corrections. Models with the remaining four corrections generally fit ... about equally well, with the combined surface correction by Ball \& Gizon perhaps being marginally superior. The fits broadly agree on the model parameters within about the \$2\textbackslash sigma\$ uncertainties, with discrepancies between the modified Lorentzian and free power law corrections occasionally exceeding the \$3\textbackslash sigma\$ level. Relative to the best-fitting values, the total uncertainties on the masses, radii and ages of the stars are all less than 2, 1 and 6 per cent, respectively. A solar-calibrated power law ... appears unsuitable for use with more evolved solar-like oscillators. Among the remaining surface corrections, the uncertainty in the model parameters introduced by the surface effects is about twice as large as the uncertainty in the individual fits for these six stars. Though the fits are thus somewhat less certain because of our uncertainty of how to manage the surface effect, these results also demonstrate that it is feasible to model the individual mode frequencies of subgiants and low-luminosity red giants. ...},

In the next decade, the extent of the external convective zone of
solar-like stars will have to be derived from the eigenfrequencies of
their low-degree ({$\mathscr{l}$}=0,1 and 2) acoustic modes. In this paper, we
compare different tracers of the base of the convective zone (BCZ) and
show that the second difference {$\delta$}2{$\nu$} stays simple and
well suited for analyzing real data. We suggest the use of
\textbackslash tilde\{t\}BCZ=(2{$<\Delta\nu>$})-1 -
\textbackslash tilde\{{$\tau\rbrace$}BCZ as a quasi-non-biased indicator of the BCZ
acoustic radius. The method is first checked on a long-time solar
observation with GOLF, then on shorter real observations by VIRGO and 10
000 simulated observations of solar-like stars. We present results for
different observational duration and stellar masses. The intrinsic error
due to the method on the convective extent is smaller than 1.5\% (in
units of stellar acoustic radius) for stars with masses between 0.9 and
1.3 M{$\odot$}. The limited observational interval adds a
supplementary uncertainty of about 1.6\% for a 150-day long simulated
observation. In this study, we have also analyzed the effects of
stochastic excitation and of non-continuous runs of shorter lengths. We
discuss how to take into account the variations in activity.

We present a theoretical study of the errors of p-mode parameters determined by means of a maximum-likelihood estimator, and we also analyze correlations and biases. We have used different, complementary approaches: we have performed either semi-analytical computation of the Hessian matrix, fitting of single mean profiles, or Monte Carlo simulations. We give first analytical approximations for the errors of frequency, inclination and rotational splitting. The determination of the inclination is very challenging for the common case of slow rotators (like the Sun), making difficult the determination of a reliable rotational splitting. Moreover, due to the numerous correlations, biases - more or less significant - can appear in the determination of various parameters in the case of bad inclination fittings, especially when a locking at 90 degrees occurs. This issue concerning inclination locking is also discussed. Nevertheless, the central frequency and some derived parameters such as the total power of the mode are free of such biases.},

  abstract = {The surprising thinness of the solar tachocline is still not understood with certainty today. Among the numerous possible scenarios suggested to explain its radial confinement, one hypothesis is based on Maxwell stresses that are exerted by the cyclic dynamo magnetic field of the Sun penetrating over a skin depth below the turbulent convection zone. Our goal is to assess under which conditions (turbulence level in the tachocline, strength of the dynamo-generated field, spreading mechanism) this scenario can be realized in the solar tachocline. We develop a simplified 1D model of the upper tachocline under the influence of an oscillating magnetic field imposed from above. The turbulent transport is parametrized with enhanced turbulent diffusion (or anti-diffusion) coefficients. Two main processes that thicken the tachocline are considered; either turbulent viscous spreading or radiative spreading. An extensive parameter study is carried out to establish the physical parameter regimes under which magnetic confinement of the tachocline that is due to a surface dynamo field can be realized. We have explored a large range of magnetic field amplitudes, viscosities, ohmic diffusivities and thermal diffusivities. We find that, for large but still realistic magnetic field strengths, the differential rotation can be suppressed in the upper radiative zone (and hence the tachocline confined) if weak turbulence is present (with an enhanced ohmic diffusivity of \$\textbackslash eta {$>$} 10\^\{7-8\} \textbackslash, cm\^2/s\$), even in the presence of radiative spreading. Our results show that a dynamo magnetic field can, in the presence of weak turbulence, prevent the inward burrowing of a tachocline subject to viscous diffusion or radiative spreading.},

  abstract = {Rotation periods are increasingly being used to derive ages for cool single field stars. Such ages are based on an empirical understanding of how cool stars spin down, acquired by constructing color-period diagrams (CPDs) for a series of open clusters. Our main aims here are to construct a CPD for M 48, to compare this with other clusters of similar age to check for consistency, and to derive a rotational age for M 48 using gyrochronology. We monitored M 48 photometrically for over 2 months with AIP's STELLA I 1.2 m telescope and the WiFSIP 4K imager in Tenerife. Light curves with 3 mmag precision for bright (V \textasciitilde{} 14 mag) stars were produced and then analysed to provide rotation periods. A cluster CPD has then been constructed. We report 62 rotation periods for cool stars in M 48. The CPD displays a clear slow/I-sequence of rotating stars, similar to those seen in the 625 Myr-old Hyades and 590 Myr-old Praesepe clusters, and below both, confirming that M 48 is younger. A similar comparison with the 250 Myr-old M 34 cluster shows that M 48 is older and does not possess any fast/C-sequence G or early K stars like those in M 34, although relatively fast rotators do seem to be present among the late-K and M stars. A more detailed comparison of the CPD with rotational evolution models shows that the cluster stars have a mean age of 450 Myr, and its (rotating) stars can be individually dated to {$\pm$} 117 Myr (26\%). Much of this uncertainty stems from intrinsic astrophysical spread in initial periods, and almost all stars are consistent with a single age of 450 Myr. The gyro-age of M 48 as a whole is 450 {$\pm$} 50 Myr, in agreement with the previously determined isochrone age of 400 {$\pm$} 100 Myr.

The rotation periods delineate a sequence in the color-period diagram (CPD) of increasing period with redder color. This sequence represents a cross-section at the cluster age of the surface P = P(t, M), suggested in prior work to extend to at least solar age. The current Sun is located marginally (approximately 1{$\sigma$}) above M67 in the CPD, as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the P = P(t, M) surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude that the solar rotation rate is normal as compared with cluster stars, a fact that strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement between the M67 rotation period measurements and prior predictions further implies that rotation periods, especially when coupled with appropriate supporting work such as spectroscopy, can provide reliable ages via gyrochronology for other similar FGK dwarfs from the early main sequence to solar age and likely until the main sequence turnoff. The M67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr with a standard deviation of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be age-dated to precisions of{\~ }17\%.

  abstract = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for 
solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star
observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences,
initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These
sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve
systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude
rotational isochrones allowing ``stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure,
on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age
and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the
underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The
majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or
interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to
both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds
can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style.
An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid
rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient
in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface
convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone
is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet
possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated
with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled
radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative
zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence
through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases.
Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate
an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition.
Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme,
which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and
collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this
bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also
provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric
activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena
that depend on rotation.

  abstract = {We here develop an improved way of using a rotating star as a clock, set it using the Sun, and demonstrate that it keeps time well. This technique, called gyrochronology, derives ages for low-mass main-sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is developed here and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby field stars with measured rotation periods. We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extend it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at \textasciitilde 15\% (plus possible systematic errors) for late F, G, K, and early M stars. Gyro ages for the Mount Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main-sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators. These are shown to have a median age of 365 Myr. The sample of single field stars assembled by Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed and shown to have gyro ages ranging from under 100 Myr to several Gyr, with a median age of 1.2 Gyr. Finally, we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries {$\xi$} Boo AB, 61 Cyg AB, and {$\alpha$} Cen AB yield substantially the same gyro ages.},

  abstract = {We here introduce a simple nonlinear model to describe the rotational evolution of cool stars on the main sequence. It is formulated only in terms of the Rossby number (Ro = P/{$\tau$}), its inverse, and two dimensionless constants which we specify using solar and open-cluster data. The model has two limiting cases of stellar rotation, previously called C and I, that correspond to two observed sequences of fast and slowly rotating stars in young open clusters. The model describes the evolution of stars from C-type, with particular mass and age dependencies, to I-type, with different mass and age dependencies, through the rotational gap, g, separating them. The proposed model explains various aspects of stellar rotation, and provides an exact expression for the age of a rotating cool star in terms of P and {$\tau$}, thereby generalizing gyrochronology. Using it, we calculate the time interval required for stars to reach the rotational gap\textemdash a monotonically increasing, mildly nonlinear function of {$\tau$}. Beginning with the range of initial periods indicated by observations, we show that the (mass-dependent) dispersion in rotation period initially increases, and then decreases rapidly with the passage of time. The initial dispersion in period contributes up to 128 Myr to the gyro-age errors of solar-mass field stars. Finally, we transform to color-period space, calculate appropriate isochrones, and show that this model explains some detailed features in the observed color-period diagrams of open clusters, including the positions and shapes of the sequences, and the observed density of stars across these diagrams.},

  abstract = {Surface gravity is one of a star's basic properties, but it is difficult to measure accurately, with typical uncertainties of 25-50 per cent if measured spectroscopically and 90-150 per cent photometrically. Asteroseismology measures gravity with an uncertainty of about two per cent but is restricted to relatively small samples of bright stars, most of which are giants. The availability of high-precision measurements of brightness variations for {$>$}150,000 stars provides an opportunity to investigate whether the variations can be used to determine surface gravities. The Fourier power of granulation on a star's surface correlates physically with surface gravity; if brightness variations on timescales of hours arise from granulation, then such variations should correlate with surface gravity. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals an observational correlation between surface gravity and the root-mean-square brightness variations on timescales of less than eight hours for stars with temperatures of 4500-6750K, log of surface gravities of 2.5-4.5 (cgs units), and having overall brightness variations {$<$}3 parts per thousand. A straightforward observation of optical brightness variations therefore allows a determination of the surface gravity with a precision of {$<$}25 percent for inactive Sun-like stars at main-sequence to giant stages of evolution.},

We describe in detail how we extract the flicker signal from the light curves, including how we treat phenomena, such as exoplanet transits and shot noise, that adversely affect the measurement of flicker. We examine the limitations of the technique, and, as a result, we now provide an updated treatment of the flicker-based logg error.

set of solar p-mode frequencies from low to intermediate degree that
allow one to determine the structure of much of the solar interior,
avoiding systematic errors that are introduced when different data sets
are combined, i.e., principally the effects of solar cycle changes on
the frequencies. Observations made by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations
Network (BiSON) in integrated sunlight provide high-accuracy
measurements of a large number of low-degree modes. In this paper we
demonstrate that the low-degree mode set of the LOWL data can be
successfully combined with the more accurate BiSON data, provided the
observations are contemporaneous for those frequencies where the solar
cycle induced effects are important. We show that this leads to a factor
of 2 decrease in the error on the inferred sound speed in the solar
core. We find that the solar sound speed is higher than in solar models
for r less than 0.2 solar radius. The density of the solar core is,
however, lower than that in solar models.},

Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for \&gt;4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties.

Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes, and indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here, we report the detection of non-rigid rotation in the interiors of red-giant stars by exploiting the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected mixed modes. We demonstrate an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core. Comparing with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior.},

  abstract = {Rotation plays a key role in stellar structure and its evolution. Through transport processes which induce rotational mixing of chemical species and the redistribution of angular momentum, internal stellar rotation influences the evolutionary tracks in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In turn, evolution influences the rotational properties. Therefore, information on the rotational properties of the deep interior would help to better understand the stellar evolution. However, as the internal rotational profile cannot be measured directly, it remains a major unknown leaving this important aspect of models unconstrained. We can test for nonrigid rotation inside the stars with asteroseismology. Through the effect of rotational splitting of non-radial oscillation modes, we investigate the internal rotation profile indirectly. Red giants have very slow rotation rates leading to a rotational splitting on the level of a few tenth of a \textbackslash muHz. Only from more than 1.5 years of consecutive data from the NASA Kepler space telescope, these tiny variations could be resolved. A qualitative comparison to theoretical models allowed constraining the core-to-surface rotation rate for some of these evolved stars. In this paper, we report on the first results of a large sample study of splitting of individual dipole modes.},

  abstract = {Observers have long measured solar rotation with different techniques and obtained different results. This paper compares differential rotation measurements from four techniques: Doppler shift, Doppler feature tracking, magnetic feature tracking, and p-mode splittings. The different rotation rates measured by the first three techniques are interpreted as rotation rates of solar phenomena which depend on the properties and depth of that which is measured. This interpretation is supported by comparison with rotation measurements obtained from p-mode splittings except for Doppler features. The rotation rate of the plasma corresponds to the surface rate obtained by inversions; the rates of magnetic features correspond to the rotation rate at various depths within the convection zone. Supergranulation rotates at a rate greater than the maximum rotation rate within the convection zone, suggesting that supergranules are not simple convection cells anchored at a particular depth.},

  abstract = {We have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-series photometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the Kepler Mission. The light curves, obtained with 30 minute sampling, reveal clear oscillations in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in luminosity from the red clump down to the bottom of the giant branch. We confirm a strong correlation between the large separation of the oscillations ({$\Delta\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power
({$\nu$}max). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars ({$\nu$}max {$>$} 100 {$\mu$}Hz, L {$<\sptilde$} 30 L sun) having
high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the unambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning stars, whose
oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar evolution and for constraining the star formation rate in the local disk. We use a new technique to compare stars on a single \'echelle diagram by
scaling their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial and non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degree l = 3. Measuring the small separation between l = 0 and l = 2 allows us to plot the so-called C-D diagram of
{$\delta\nu$}02 versus {$\Delta\nu$}. The small separation
{$\delta\nu$}01 of l = 1 from the midpoint of adjacent l = 0
modes is negative, contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge for l = 1 is notably broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoretical predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall, the results demonstrate the tremendous potential of Kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.},

  abstract = {Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell. Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly \textasciitilde 50seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing \textasciitilde 100 to 300 seconds).},

In this framework, scaling laws between asteroseismic quantities and stellar parameters are becoming essential tools to study a rich variety of stars. However, the physical underlying mechanisms of those scaling laws are still poorly known. Our objective is to provide a theoretical basis for the scaling between the frequency of the maximum in the power spectrum
({$\nu$}max) of solar-like oscillations and the cut-off
frequency ({$\nu$}c). Using the SoHO GOLF observations together with theoretical considerations, we first confirm that the maximum of the height in oscillation power spectrum is determined by the so-called plateau of the damping rates. The physical origin of the plateau can be traced to the destabilizing effect of the Lagrangian perturbation of entropy in the upper-most layers, which becomes important when the modal period and the local thermal relaxation time-scale are comparable. Based on this analysis, we then find a linear relation between
{$\nu$}max and {$\nu$}c, with a coefficient that depends on the ratio of the Mach number of the exciting turbulence to the third power to the mixing-length parameter.},

  abstract = {The search for twins of the Sun and Earth relies on accurate characterization of stellar and exoplanetary parameters: i.e., ages, masses, and radii. In the modern era of asteroseismology, parameters of solar-like stars are derived by fitting theoretical models to observational data, which include measurements of their oscillation frequencies, metallicity [Fe/H], and effective temperature Teff. Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the corresponding parameters for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are commonly stated to a precision of \textasciitilde 0.1 dex and \textasciitilde 100 K, the impact of errors in their measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of the parameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjust the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux systematic errors and artificially increasing the reported uncertainties, and quantify the differences in the resulting parameters. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4\%, 2\%, and 1\% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within their uncertainties (\textasciitilde 11\%, 3.5\%, 1.4\%) as derived by SPI. We also find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M\_sun, and 0.01 R\_sun, which are again well below their reported uncertainties (0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M\_sun, 0.02 R\_sun). The results for Teff at 100 K are similar. Stellar parameters from SPI are unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K, and are even more robust to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations. Consequently, the parameters for their exoplanets are robust as well.},

Usually, these predictions can be assessed only indirectly, for example by comparing predicted and observed effective temperatures and luminosities. Thanks now to asteroseismology, which can reveal the internal structure of stars, it becomes possible to compare the predictions from stellar evolution theory to actual stellar structures. In this work, we present an inverse analysis of the oscillation data from the solar-type star KIC 6225718, which was observed by the \textbackslash emph\{Kepler\} space observatory during its nominal mission. As its mass is about 20\% greater than solar, this star is predicted to transport energy by convection in its nuclear-burning core. We find significant differences between the predicted and actual structure of the star in the radiative interior near to the convective core. In particular, the predicted sound speed is higher than observed in the deep interior of the star, and too low at a fractional radius of 0.25 and beyond. The cause of these discrepancies is unknown, and is not remedied by known physics in the form of convective overshooting or elemental diffusion.},

The candidate scaling relations are calibrated and tested using more than 1,000 red giant stars whose ages were obtained via grid-based modeling.

  abstract = {Context. With the discovery over the last two decades of a large diversity of exoplanetary systems, it is now of prime importance to
characterize star-planet interactions and how such systems evolve. Aims: We address this question by studying systems formed by a
solar-like star and a close-in planet. We focus on the stellar wind
spinning down the star along its main-sequence phase and tidal
interaction causing orbital evolution of the systems. Despite recent
significant advances in these fields, all current models use parametric
descriptions to study at least one of these effects. Our objective is to
introduce ab initio prescriptions of the tidal and braking torques
simultaneously, so as to improve our understanding of the underlying
physics. Methods: We develop a one-dimensional (1D) numerical
model of coplanar circular star-planet systems taking into account
stellar structural changes, wind braking, and tidal interaction and
implement it in a code called ESPEM. We follow the secular evolution of
the stellar rotation and of the semi-major axis of the orbit, assuming a
bilayer internal structure for the former. After comparing our
predictions to recent observations and models, we perform tests to
emphasize the contribution of ab initio prescriptions. Finally, we
isolate four significant characteristics of star-planet systems: stellar
mass, initial stellar rotation period, planetary mass and initial
semi-major axis; and browse the parameter space to investigate the
influence of each of them on the fate of the system. Results: Our
secular model of stellar wind braking accurately reproduces the recent
observations of stellar rotation in open clusters. Our results show that
a planet can affect the rotation of its host star and that the resulting
spin-up or spin-down depends on the orbital semi-major axis and on the
joint influence of magnetic and tidal effects. The ab initio
prescription for tidal dissipation that we used predicts fast outward
migration of massive planets orbiting fast-rotating young stars.
Finally, we provide the reader with a criterion based on the
characteristics of the system that allows us to assess whether or not
the planet will undergo orbital decay due to tidal interaction.},

  abstract = {Context. The helioseismic determination of the solar age has been a subject of several studies because it provides us with an independent estimation of the age of the solar system. Aims: We present the Bayesian estimates of the helioseismic age of the Sun, which are determined by means of calibrated solar models that employ different equations of state and nuclear reaction rates. Methods: We use 17 frequency separation ratios r02(n) = ({$\nu$}n,l =
0-{$\nu$}n-1,l = 2)/({$\nu$}n,l = 1-{$\nu$}n-1,l
= 1) from 8640 days of low-{$\mathscr{l}$}BiSON frequencies and consider three likelihood functions that depend on the handling of the errors of these r02(n) ratios. Moreover, we employ the 2010 CODATA recommended values for Newton's constant, solar mass, and radius to calibrate a large grid of solar models spanning a conceivable range of solar ages. Results: It is shown that the most constrained posterior distribution of the solar age for models employing Irwin EOS with NACRE reaction rates leads to t{$\odot$} = 4.587 {$\pm$}
0.007 Gyr, while models employing the Irwin EOS and Adelberger, et al. (2011, Rev. Mod. Phys., 83, 195) reaction rate have t{$\odot$} = 4.569 {$\pm$} 0.006 Gyr. Implementing OPAL EOS in the solar models
results in reduced evidence ratios (Bayes factors) and leads to an age that is not consistent with the meteoritic dating of the solar system. Conclusions: An estimate of the solar age that relies on an helioseismic age indicator such as r02(n) turns out to be essentially independent of the type of likelihood function. However, with respect to model selection, abandoning any information concerning the errors of the r02(n) ratios leads to inconclusive results, and this stresses the importance of evaluating the
trustworthiness of error estimates.},

In this work it will be shown that if the coronal field of these stars is assumed to be harmonic, the underlying stellar dynamo mechanism can support photospheric magnetic fields with a prominent toroidal component even in the presence of axisymmetric magnetic topologies. In particular it is argued that the observed increase in the toroidal energy in low mass fast rotating stars can be naturally explained with an underlying \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash Omega\$ mechanism.},

The Kepler Mission is designed specifically to determine the frequency of terrestrial planets in the HZ. It was launched on March 6, 2009 and is now measuring the brightness variations of 150,000 solar-like stars to detect patterns of transits that provide the size of the planet relative to the star and its orbital period. Combining these measurements with ground-based spectroscopy fixes the stellar parameters, the planet radius, orbital semi-major axis, and the location relative to the HZ. The first six weeks of data show the presence of hundreds of candidate planets, and thousands of eclipsing binary stars, and variable stars of amazing variety. Discoveries of five new exoplanets are shown and compared with known exoplanets with respect to mass, size, density, and orbital period. Over 750 planetary candidates found in the first year of data; with many smaller than Neptune.. The released data include five possible multi-planet systems. One of these has two Neptune-size (2.3 and 2.5 Earth-radius) candidates with near-resonant periods. Data for these discoveries were released in June. Examples of many of these discoveries and their distributions are presented and discussed. . Support by the NASA Astrophysics Division is gratefully acknowledged.},

We performed a four-orbit reconnaissance with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to study the stellar emission at Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$, to assess the presence of hydrogen exospheres around the two inner planets, and to determine their UV irradiation. We detect the Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ line of TRAPPIST-1, making it the coldest exoplanet host star for which this line has been measured. We reconstruct the intrinsic line profile, showing that it lacks broad wings and is much fainter than expected from the stellar X-ray emission. TRAPPIST-1 has a similar X-ray emission as Proxima Cen but a much lower Ly-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emission. This suggests that TRAPPIST-1 chromosphere is only moderately active compared to its transition region and corona. We estimated the atmospheric mass loss rates for all planets, and found that despite a moderate extreme UV emission the total XUV irradiation could be strong enough to strip the atmospheres of the inner planets in a few billions years. We detect marginal flux decreases at the times of TRAPPIST-1b and c transits, which might originate from stellar activity, but could also hint at the presence of extended hydrogen exospheres. Understanding the origin of these Lyman-\$\textbackslash alpha\$ variations will be crucial in assessing the atmospheric stability and potential habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

We examine the responses of both an `Earth-like' atmosphere and simplified nitrogen and trace carbon dioxide atmosphere to the radiation likely received by Proxima Centauri B. Additionally, we explore the effects of orbital eccentricity on the planetary conditions using a range of eccentricities guided by the observational constraints. Overall, our results are in agreement with previous studies in suggesting Proxima Centauri B may well have surface temperatures conducive to the presence of liquid water. Moreover, we have expanded the parameter regime over which the planet may support liquid water to higher values of eccentricity ({$>$}= 0.1) and lower incident fluxes (881.7 Wm-2) than previous work. This increased parameter space arises because of the low sensitivity of the planet to changes in stellar flux, a consequence of the stellar spectrum and orbital configuration. However, we also find interesting differences from previous simulations, such as cooler mean surface temperatures for the tidally-locked case. Finally, we have produced high resolution planetary emission and reflectance spectra, and highlight signatures of gases vital to the evolution of complex life on Earth (oxygen, ozone and carbon dioxide).},

from the first two years of APOGEE operations, selected based on their
position in color-metallicity-surface-gravity-effective-temperature
space using a new method calibrated using stellar evolution models and
high-quality asteroseismology data. The narrowness of the RC locus in
color-metallicity-luminosity space allows us to assign distances to the
stars with an accuracy of 5\%-10\%. The sample extends to typical
distances of about 3 kpc from the Sun, with some stars out to 8 kpc, and
spans a volume of approximately 100 kpc3 over 5 kpc {$<\sptilde$} R

photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, reddening estimates,
distances, line-of-sight velocities, stellar parameters and elemental
abundances determined from the high-resolution APOGEE spectra, and
matches to major proper motion catalogs. We determine the survey
selection function for this data set and discuss how the RC selection
samples the underlying stellar populations. We use this sample to limit
any azimuthal variations in the median metallicity within the

Our first results indicate small but significant systematic differences between the classical and asteroseismic measurements. In this contribution we show our latest results and summarize the current status and future plans.

The T\textsubscript{eff} of the components of the eclipsing binary member V69 is found to be 5900 {$\pm$} 72 K from both photometric and spectroscopic evidence.

We measured precise properties of the three eclipsing binary systems KIC 7037405, KIC 9540226, and KIC 9970396 and estimated their ages be 5.3 {$\pm$} 0.5, 3.1 {$\pm$} 0.6, and 4.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr. The measurements of the giant stars were compared to corresponding measurements of mass, radius, and age using asteroseismic scaling relations and grid modelling. We found that asteroseismic scaling relations without corrections to {$\increment\nu$} systematically overestimate the masses of the three red giants by 11.7 per cent, 13.7 per cent, and 18.9 per cent, respectively. However, by applying theoretical correction factors f\textsubscript{{$\increment\nu$}} according to Rodrigues et al. (2017), we reached general agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic mass estimates, and no indications of systematic differences at the precision level of the asteroseismic measurements. The larger sample investigated by Gaulme et al. (2016) showed a much more complicated situation, where some stars show agreement between the dynamical and corrected asteroseismic measures while others suggest significant overestimates of the asteroseismic measures. We found no simple explanation for this, but indications of several potential problems, some theoretical, others observational. Therefore, an extension of the present precision study to a larger sample of eclipsing systems is crucial for establishing and improving the accuracy of asteroseismology of giant stars.},

  abstract = {Regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are often referred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodic signature in the frequencies of p modes. Here we examine the localized disturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branch and clump stars. More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely the parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation frequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different generation codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along the red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances. We discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately determine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. The determined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies were found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic exponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of the second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method can be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a definite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would be difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different helium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters can be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for distinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular clusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have been observed.},

  abstract = {The solar-activity-cycle minimum observed between Cycles 23 and 24 is generally regarded as being unusually deep and long. That minimum is being followed by one of the smallest amplitude cycles in recent history. We perform an in-depth analysis of this minimum with helioseismology. We use Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) data to demonstrate that the frequencies of helioseismic oscillations are a sensitive probe of the Sun's magnetic field: The frequencies of the helioseismic oscillations were found to be systematically lower in the minimum following Cycle 23 than in the minimum preceding it. This difference is statistically significant and may indicate that the Sun's global magnetic field was weaker in the minimum following Cycle 23. The size of the shift in oscillation frequencies between the two minima is dependent on the frequency of the oscillation and takes the same functional form as the frequency dependence observed when the frequencies at cycle maximum are compared with the cycle-minimum frequencies. This implies that the same near-surface magnetic perturbation is responsible. Finally, we determine that the difference in the mean magnetic field between the minimum preceding Cycle 23 and that following it is approximately 1G.},

  abstract = {In the course of a search for solar-like oscillations in bright late-type stars, Doppler variability was observed in the F5 subgiant Procyon. The variations have frequencies within a 1.1 mHz range centered at 0.9 mHz, and a total rms amplitude within that range of 2.5 m/s. Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation, indicating that the variations seen on Procyon are of stellar origin. The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well. In order to clarify the sources of ambiguity in this and similar observations, the data acquisition, reduction, and interpretation are described.},

  abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. \\
 Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. \\
 Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. \\
 Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1} for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. \\
 Conclusions: Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

  abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. \\
 Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. \\
 Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. \\
 Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the G\textsubscript{BP} (330-680 nm) and G\textsubscript{RP} (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. \\
 Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

They find an upper limit to the orbital eccentricity of 0.35. To investigate the eccentricity issue further, we calculate a suite of monovariate and bivariate densities o eccentricity. After discarding apparent artifacts at eccentricity = 0 and = 1, we find that eccentricity has a trimodal sampling distribution: three chimeras or types of orbit compatible with the RV data set. The three modes or peaks in the density of eccentricity are located at eccentricity = 0.25, 0.75, and 0.95, with relative weights 0.79, 0.10, and 0.11. Future RV observations will clarify which of the three chimeras represents the true eccentricity of Proxima b. The most-likely estimate is eccentricity = 0.25, and our lower limit is eccentricity = 0.025. Our strategic, long-term goal is to elevate the orbital analyses of exoplanets to meet the challenges of sometimes complex probability density distributions.},

  abstract = {The operation of the solar global dynamo appears to involve many 
dynamical elements, including the generation of fields by the intense
turbulence of the deep convection zone, the transport of these fields
into the tachocline region near the base of the convection zone, the
storage and amplification of toroidal fields in the tachocline by
differential rotation, and the destabilization and emergence of such
fields due to magnetic buoyancy. Self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations that realistically incorporate all of these processes
are not yet computationally feasible, although some elements can now be
studied with reasonable fidelity. Here we consider the manner in which
turbulent compressible convection within the bulk of the solar
convection zone can generate large-scale magnetic fields through dynamo
action. We accomplish this through a series of three-dimensional
numerical simulations of MHD convection within rotating spherical shells
using our anelastic spherical harmonic (ASH) code on massively parallel
supercomputers. Since differential rotation is a key ingredient in all
dynamo models, we also examine here the nature of the rotation profiles
that can be sustained within the deep convection zone as strong magnetic
fields are built and maintained. We find that the convection is able to
maintain a solar-like angular velocity profile despite the influence of
Maxwell stresses, which tend to oppose Reynolds stresses and thus reduce
the latitudinal angular velocity contrast throughout the convection
zone. The dynamo-generated magnetic fields exhibit a complex structure
and evolution, with radial fields concentrated in downflow lanes and
toroidal fields organized into twisted ribbons that are extended in
longitude and achieve field strengths of up to 5000 G. The flows and
fields exhibit substantial kinetic and magnetic helicity although
systematic hemispherical patterns are only apparent in the former.
Fluctuating fields dominate the magnetic energy and account for most of
the back-reaction on the flow via Lorentz forces. Mean fields are
relatively weak and do not exhibit systematic latitudinal propagation or
periodic polarity reversals as in the Sun. This may be attributed to the
absence of a tachocline, i.e., a penetrative boundary layer between the
convection zone and the deeper radiative interior possessing strong
rotational shear. The influence of such a layer will await subsequent
studies.},

Major sources of astrophysical false positives are planetary transits and stellar eclipses on background stars. We describe several new techniques for the identification of background transit sources that are separated from their target stars, indicating an astrophysical false positive. These techniques use only Kepler photometric data. We describe the concepts and construction of these techniques in detail as well as their performance and relative merits.},

The giant planet metallicity correlation has now been widely accepted, but questions remain as to whether the metallicity correlation extends to the small terrestrial-sized planets. Here, we report
metallicities for a sample of 518 stars in the Kepler field that have no detected transiting planets and compare their metallicity distribution to a sample of stars that hosts small planets (\{R\}p\textbackslash lt 1.7 \{R\}\textbackslash oplus ). Importantly, both samples have been analyzed in a homogeneous manner using the same set of tools (Stellar Parameters Classification tool). We find the average metallicity of the sample of stars without detected transiting planets to be
\{[\{\{m\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{SNTP,\{dwarf\}\}=-0.02+/- 0.02 \{dex\} and the sample of stars hosting small planets to be
\{[\{\{m\}\}/\{\{H\}\}]\}\{STP\}=-0.02+/- 0.02 \{dex\}. The average metallicities of the two samples are indistinguishable within the uncertainties, and the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yields a p-value of 0.68 (0.41{$\sigma$}), indicating a failure to reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from the same parent
population. We conclude that the homogeneous analysis of the data presented here supports the hypothesis that stars hosting small planets have a metallicity similar to stars with no known transiting planets in the same area of the sky.},

  abstract = {The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale stellar spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way, designed to deliver complementary chemical information to a large number of stars covered by the Gaia mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2) containing 342 682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], vmic, vsin i, A\_\{K\_S\}) for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar
atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from Gaia will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.},

  abstract = {Helioseismology is one of the most successful fields of astrophysics. The observation and characterization of solar oscillation has allowed solar seismologists to study the internal structure and dynamics of the Sun with unprecedented thoroughness. Ground-based networks and dedicated space missions have delivered data of exquisite quality, enabling the development of sophisticated inference techniques. The achievements of the fields count, amongst other, the determination of solar photospheric helium abundance, unacessible to spectroscopic constraints, the precise positioning of the base of the convective zone and the demonstration of the importance of microscopic diffusion in stellar radiative regions. Helioseismology played also a key role in validating the framework used to compute solar and stellar models and played an important role in the so-called solar neutrino problem. In the current era of astrophysics, with the increasing importance of asteroseismology to precisely characterize stars, the Sun still plays a crucial calibration role, acting as a benchmark for stellar models. With the revision of the solar abundances and the current discussions related to radiative opacity computations, the role of the Sun as a laboratory of fundamental physics is undisputable. In this brief review, I will discuss some of the inference techniques developed in the field of helioseismology, dedicated to the exploitation of the solar global oscillation modes.},

  abstract = {Context. The solar dynamo consists of a process that converts poloidal field to toroidal field followed by a process which creates new poloidal field from the toroidal field. Aims. Our aim is to observe the poloidal and toroidal fields relevant to the global solar dynamo and see if their evolution is captured by a Babcock-Leighton dynamo. Methods. We use synoptic maps of the surface radial field from the KPNSO/VT and SOLIS observatories to construct the poloidal field as a function of time and latitude, and Wilcox Solar Observatory and SOHO/MDI full disk images to infer the longitudinally averaged surface azimuthal field. We show that the latter is consistent with an estimate of that due to flux emergence and therefore closely related to the subsurface toroidal field. Results. We present maps of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field of the global solar dynamo. The longitude-averaged azimuthal field observed at the surface results from flux emergence. At high latitudes this component follows the radial component of the polar fields with a short time lag (1-3 years). The lag increases at lower latitudes. The observed evolution of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields is described by the (updated) Babcock-Leighton dynamo model.},

  abstract = {The angle {$\psi$} between a planet's orbital axis and the spin axis of its parent star is an important diagnostic of planet formation, migration, and tidal evolution. We seek empirical constraints on {$\psi$} by measuring the stellar inclination I\textsubscript{s} via asteroseismology for an ensemble of 25 solar-type hosts observed with NASA's Kepler satellite. Our results for I\textsubscript{s} are consistent with alignment at the 2{$\sigma$} level for all stars in the sample, meaning that the system surrounding the red-giant star Kepler-56 remains as the only unambiguous misaligned multiple-planet system detected to date. The availability of a measurement of the projected spin-orbit angle {$\lambda$} for two of the systems allows us to estimate {$\psi$}. We find that the orbit of the hot Jupiter HAT-P-7b is likely to be retrograde (\textbackslash psi =116\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} \{4\}\textsubscript{-14.7}\textsuperscript{+30.2}), whereas that of Kepler-25c seems to be well aligned with the stellar spin axis (\textbackslash psi =12\textbackslash buildrel\{\textbackslash circ\}\textbackslash over\{.\} \{6\}\textsubscript{-11.0}\textsuperscript{+6.7}). While the latter result is in apparent contradiction with a statement made previously in the literature that the multi-transiting system Kepler-25 is misaligned, we show that the results are consistent, given the large associated uncertainties. Finally, we perform a hierarchical Bayesian analysis based on the asteroseismic sample in order to recover the underlying distribution of {$\psi$}. The ensemble analysis suggests that the directions of the stellar spin and planetary orbital axes are correlated, as conveyed by a tendency of the host stars to display large values of inclination.},

Throughout the course of the Kepler mission, asteroseismology has also played an important role in the characterization of exoplanet-host stars and their planetary systems. The upcoming NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will be performing a near all-sky survey for planets that transit bright nearby stars. In addition, its excellent photometric precision, combined with its fine time sampling and long intervals of uninterrupted observations, will enable asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant stars. Here we develop a simple test to estimate the detectability of solar-like oscillations in TESS photometry of any given star. Based on an all-sky stellar and planetary synthetic population, we go on to predict the asteroseismic yield of the TESS mission, placing emphasis on the yield of exoplanet-host stars for which we expect to detect solar-like oscillations. This is done for both the target stars (observed at a 2-minute cadence) and the full-frame-image stars (observed at a 30-minute cadence). A similar exercise is also conducted based on a compilation of known host stars. We predict that TESS will detect solar-like oscillations in a few dozen target hosts (mainly subgiant stars but also in a smaller number of F dwarfs), in up to 200 low-luminosity red-giant hosts, and in over 100 solar-type and red-giant known hosts, thereby leading to a threefold improvement in the asteroseismic yield of exoplanet-host stars when compared to Kepler's.},

  abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is performing a near all-sky survey for planets that transit bright stars. In addition, its excellent photometric precision enables asteroseismology of solar-type and red-giant stars, which exhibit convection-driven, solar-like oscillations. Simulations predict that TESS will detect solar-like oscillations in nearly 100 stars already known to host planets. In this paper, we present an asteroseismic analysis of the known red-giant host stars HD 212771 and HD 203949, both systems having a long-period planet detected through radial velocities. These are the first detections of oscillations in previously known exoplanet-host stars by TESS, further showcasing the mission's potential to conduct asteroseismology of red-giant stars. We estimate the fundamental properties of both stars through a grid-based modeling approach that uses global asteroseismic parameters as input. We discuss the evolutionary state of HD 203949 in depth and note the large discrepancy between its asteroseismic mass (\$M\_\textbackslash ast = 1.23 \textbackslash pm 0.15\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ if on the red-giant branch or \$M\_\textbackslash ast = 1.00 \textbackslash pm 0.16\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$ if in the clump) and the mass quoted in the discovery paper (\$M\_\textbackslash ast = 2.1 \textbackslash pm 0.1\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm M\}\_\textbackslash odot\$), implying a change \$\&gt;30\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ in the planet's mass. Assuming HD 203949 to be in the clump, we investigate the planet's past orbital evolution and discuss how it could have avoided engulfment at the tip of the red-giant branch. Finally, HD 212771 was observed by K2 during its Campaign 3, thus allowing for a preliminary comparison of the asteroseismic performances of TESS and K2. We estimate the ratio of the observed oscillation amplitudes for this star to be \$A\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\^\{\textbackslash rm TESS\}/A\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\^\{\textbackslash rm K2\} = 0.75 \textbackslash pm 0.14\$, consistent with the expected ratio of \$\textbackslash sim0.85\$ due to the redder bandpass of TESS.},

Colour- magnitude diagrams are presented for several such clusters, in which relative proper motions have been used to eliminate non-members. The published observations of other old clusters are suinmarized. A prominent feature of all these clusters is a' clump `of red giants, centred near Mv = + I, B-V = +i.o, which is tentatively identified with the horizontal branch found in globular clusters. Comparison with various theoretical calculations, mostly by I. Iben and J. Faulkner, supports this identification and indicates that the stars have a helium-burning core surrounded by a hydrogen-burning shell. The near constancy of the absolute magnitude of the clump is then interpreted as observational evidence for the occurrence of electron degeneracy in the cores of low mass red giants. The use of the clump for crude determinations of cluster distances and reddening, and as evidence of the internal composition of the stars, is advocated. Finally, it is suggested that a large number of field red giants may be in the helium-burning phase of evolution some of which may be used to investigate mass loss and internal mixing in evolving stars.},

The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the sub-milliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. In this study we aim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. We compile a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then apply an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

observations on this star simultaneously conducted with two
spectrographs: Coralie mounted on the 1.2-m Swiss telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory (Chile) and Elodie based on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France). In total, 1239 spectra were collected over 13 nights. The power spectrum of the high precision velocity time series clearly presents several identifiable peaks between 0.4 and 1.0 mHz showing regularity with a large and small separation of {$\Delta\nu$} = 39.9 {$\mu$}Hz and {$\delta\nu$}02 = 3.95 {$\mu$}Hz
respectively. Twenty-two individual frequencies have been identified. Detailed models based on these measurements and non-asteroseismic observables were computed using the Geneva evolution code including shellular rotation and atomic diffusion. By combining these
seismological data with non-asteroseismic observations, we determine the following global parameters for {$\eta$} Boo: a mass of 1.57 {$\pm$} 0.07 M{$\odot$}, an age t=2.67 {$\pm$} 0.10 Gyr
and an initial metallicity (Z/X)i=0.0391 {$\pm$} 0.0070. We also show that the mass of {$\eta$} Boo is very
sensitive to the choice of the observed metallicity, while the age of {$\eta$} Boo depends on the input physics used. Indeed, a higher metallicity favours a higher mass, while non-rotating models without overshooting predict a smaller age.},

When coupling this information with classical determinations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effective temperatures, and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for Galactic studies can be obtained. The ongoing Str\"omgren survey for Asteroseismology and Galactic Archaeology has the goal of transforming the Kepler field into a new benchmark for Galactic studies, similar to the solar neighborhood. Here we present the first results from a stripe centered at a Galactic longitude of 74\textdegree{} and covering latitude from about 8\textdegree{} to 20\textdegree, which includes almost 1000 K giants with seismic information and the benchmark open cluster NGC 6819. We describe the coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as the caveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances, surface gravities, masses, and radii. Confidence in the achieved precision is corroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clumps in a population of field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1 and by the negligible scatter in the seismic distances among NGC 6819 member stars. An assessment of the reliability of stellar parameters in the Kepler Input Catalog is also performed, and the impact of our results for population studies in the Milky Way is discussed, along with the importance of an all-sky Str\"omgren survey.

Here, we measure it directly for the first time with seismic ages, using red giants observed by Kepler. We use Str\"omgren photometry to gauge the selection function of asteroseismic targets, and derive colour and magnitude limits where giants with measured oscillations are representative of the underlying population in the field. Limits in the 2MASS system are also derived. We lay out a method to assess and correct for target selection effects independent of Galaxy models. We find that low-mass, I.e. old red giants dominate at increasing Galactic heights, whereas closer to the Galactic plane they exhibit a wide range of ages and metallicities. Parametrizing this as a vertical gradient returns approximately 4 Gyr kpc\textsuperscript{-1} for the disc we probe, although with a large dispersion of ages at all heights. The ages of stars show a smooth distribution over the last {$\simeq$}10 Gyr, consistent with a mostly quiescent evolution for the Milky Way disc since a redshift of about 2. We also find a flat age-metallicity relation for disc stars. Finally, we show how to use secondary clump stars to estimate the present-day intrinsic metallicity spread, and suggest using their number count as a new proxy for tracing the ageing of the disc. This work highlights the power of asteroseismology for Galactic studies; however, we also emphasize the need for better constraints on stellar mass-loss, which is a major source of systematic age uncertainties in red giant stars.},

  abstract = {After a pedagogical introduction to the main concepts of synthetic photometry, colours and bolometric corrections in the Johnson-Cousins, 2MASS, and HST-ACS/WFC3 photometric systems are generated from MARCS synthetic fluxes for various [Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] combinations, and virtually any value of E(B - V) {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.7. The successes and failures of model fluxes in reproducing the observed magnitudes are highlighted. Overall, extant synthetic fluxes predict quite realistic broad-band colours and bolometric corrections, especially at optical and longer wavelengths: further improvements of the predictions for the blue and ultraviolet spectral regions await the use of hydrodynamic models where the microturbulent velocity is not treated as a free parameter. We show how the morphology of the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) changes for different values of [Fe/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe]; in particular, how suitable colour combinations can easily discriminate between red giant branch and lower main-sequence populations with different [{$\alpha$}/Fe], due to the concomitant loops and swings in the CMD. We also provide computer programs to produce tables of synthetic bolometric corrections as well as routines to interpolate in them. These colour-T\textsubscript{eff}-metallicity relations may be used to convert isochrones for different chemical compositions to various bandpasses assuming observed reddening values, thus bypassing the standard assumption of a constant colour excess for stars of different spectral type. We also show how such an assumption can lead to significant systematic errors. The MARCS transformations presented in this study promise to provide important constraints on our understanding of the multiple stellar populations found in globular clusters (e.g. the colours of lower main-sequence stars are predicted to depend strongly on [{$\alpha$}/Fe]) and of those located towards/in the Galactic bulge.},

Uncertainties are halved when combining bolometric corrections in more bands, and limited by the fundamental uncertainty of the current absolute flux scale at 1 per cent.

  abstract = {The discovery of lithium-rich giants contradicts expectations from canonical stellar evolution. Here we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20 Li-rich giants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey, which includes the first nine Li-rich giant stars known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants have near-solar metallicities and stellar parameters consistent with being before the luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing models proposed to explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only operate at later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an effort to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of the tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase. We note that when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed destruction of hot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich giant stars, and suggests that Li-rich stars should be found early on the giant branch and occur more frequently with increasing metallicity. A comprehensive review of all known Li-rich giant stars reveals that this scenario is consistent with the data. However, more evolved or metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant planets, implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative explanation, likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.},

We compare measured and predicted values of the magnitude difference between these two features, a rarely employed diagnostic of the internal structure of low-mass stars at the beginning of their red giant evolution. Our analysis discloses a clear discrepancy between theory and observations, the theoretical red giant branch bump magnitudes being too bright by on average \$\textbackslash sim0.2\$\textasciitilde mag. This corroborates results from the more widely studied magnitude difference between horizontal branch and red giant bump, avoiding the well known problems associated to the determination of the horizontal branch level from colour magnitude diagrams, and to uncertainties in the luminosity of horizontal branch stellar models.

Taking as a guideline the observational constraints given by Hipparcos parallaxes to the predicted luminosity of models originated from Red Giant progenitors with He core undergoing electron degeneracy, we compare models by various authors as recently appeared in the literature, disclosing sensitive differences in the predicted luminosity. The ``solidity" of these theoretical predictions is investigated by exploring the effects of varying the assumptions about the efficiency of core overshooting or the amount of mass loss, giving quantitative estimates of the related uncertainties. However, one finds that theoretical predictions concerning the luminosity of the red giant clump in the Hipparcos sample is scarcely affected by these mechanisms. \{ A comparison among theoretical predictions as recently given by different authors convincingly demonstrates that the different luminosity predictions are the natural results of evolutionary codes with different - but all reasonable- input physics.\} In this context observations suggests that stellar models based on the ``most updated" input physics are possibly overestimating the luminosity of these structures, raising doubts on several current predictions concerning the luminosity of HB stars in galactic globulars.},

For cool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to
infer stellar ages from measured rotation periods and Hertzsprung
Russell diagram positions. These relations have few calibrators with
known ages for old, long rotation period stars. There is a significant
sample of old Kepler objects of interest, or KOIs, which have both
measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic
measurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work, we
determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs
to both compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known
planets and enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars.
We use Kepler photometric light curves to derive the stellar surface
rotation periods while ages are obtained with asteroseismology using the
Asteroseismic Modelling Portal in which individual mode frequencies are
combined with high-resolution spectroscopic parameters. We thus
determine surface rotation periods and ages for 11 planet-hosting stars,
all over 2 Gyr old. We find that the planet-hosting stars exhibit a
rotational behaviour that is consistent with the latest age-rotation
models and similar to the rotational behaviour of stars without detected
planets. We conclude that these old KOIs can be used to test and
calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.},

Both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. From the asteroseismic analysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1{$\sigma$} level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. We use statistical arguments to show that coplanar orbits are favored in both systems, and that the orientations of the planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated.},

  abstract = {We consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the "super-Nyquist" regime of long-cadence (LC) Kepler photometry, i.e., above the associated Nyquist frequency of approximately 283 \{\textbackslash mu\}Hz. Targets of interest are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red-giant branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC) data, since the associated SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations. However, the number of available SC target slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the size of the ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study.We find that archival Kepler LC data from the nominal Mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of targets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as approximately 500 \{\textbackslash mu\}Hz, i.e., about 1.75- times the LC Nyquist frequency. The frequency detection threshold for the shorter-duration science campaigns of the re-purposed Kepler Mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably lie somewhere between approximately 400 and 450 \{\textbackslash mu\}Hz. The potential to exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens the door to increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red-giant targets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations imposed by the small number of SC slots.We estimate that around 400 such targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive. That number could potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for each of its campaigns.},

Data obtained during the first 10 months of Kepler science operations were used for this work, when these solar-type targets were observed for one month each in survey mode. Stellar properties have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters and complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Homogeneous sets of effective temperatures, T \textsubscript{eff}, were available for the entire ensemble from complementary photometry; spectroscopic estimates of T \textsubscript{eff} and [Fe/H] were available from a homogeneous analysis of ground-based data on a subset of 87 stars. We adopt a grid-based analysis, coupling six pipeline codes to 11 stellar evolutionary grids. Through use of these different grid-pipeline combinations we allow implicitly for the impact on the results of stellar model dependencies from commonly used grids, and differences in adopted pipeline methodologies. By using just two global parameters as the seismic inputs we are able to perform a homogenous analysis of all solar-type stars in the asteroseismic cohort, including many targets for which it would not be possible to provide robust estimates of individual oscillation frequencies (due to a combination of low signal-to-noise ratio and short dataset lengths). The median final quoted uncertainties from consolidation of the grid-based analyses are for the full ensemble (spectroscopic subset) approximately 10.8\% (5.4\%) in mass, 4.4\% (2.2\%) in radius, 0.017 dex (0.010 dex) in log g, and 4.3\% (2.8\%) in mean density. Around 36\% (57\%) of the stars have final age uncertainties smaller than 1 Gyr. These ages will be useful for ensemble studies, but should be treated carefully on a star-by-star basis. Future analyses using individual oscillation frequencies will offer significant improvements on up to 150 stars, in particular for estimates of the ages, where having the individual frequency data is most important.},

  abstract = {Over the course of its history, the Milky Way has ingested multiple smaller satellite galaxies. While these accreted stellar populations can be forensically identified as kinematically distinct structures within the Galaxy, it is difficult in general to precisely date the age at which any one merger occurred. Recent results have revealed a population of stars that were accreted via the collision of a dwarf galaxy, called \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\}-Enceladus, leading to a substantial pollution of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way. Here, we identify the very bright, naked-eye star \$\textbackslash nu\$\textbackslash,Indi as a probe of the age of the early in situ population of the Galaxy. We combine asteroseismic, spectroscopic, astrometric, and kinematic observations to show that this metal-poor, alpha-element-rich star was an indigenous member of the halo, and we measure its age to be \$11.0 \textbackslash pm 0.7\$ (stat) \$\textbackslash pm 0.8\$ (sys)\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm Gyr\$. The star bears hallmarks consistent with it having been kinematically heated by the \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\}-Enceladus collision. Its age implies that the earliest the merger could have begun was 11.6 and 13.2 Gyr ago at 68 and 95\% confidence, respectively. Input from computations based on hierarchical cosmological models tightens (i.e. reduces) slightly the above limits.},

New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being made possible by asteroseismology, the study of stars by the observation of natural, resonant oscillations. Asteroseismology is proving to be particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and COROT (Convection, Rotation \&amp; Planetary Transits) space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

  abstract = {Red clump stars are fundamental distance indicators in astrophysics, although theoretical stellar models predict a dependence of absolute magnitudes with age. This effect is particularly strong below{\~ }2 Gyr, but even above this limit a mild age dependence is still expected. We use seismically identified red clump stars in the Kepler field for which we have reliable distances, masses, and ages from the SAGA survey, to first explore this effect. By excluding red clump stars with masses larger than 1.6 \{M\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} } (corresponding to ages younger than 2 Gyr), we derive robust calibrations linking intrinsic colors to absolute magnitudes in the following photometric systems: Str\"omgren by, Johnson BV, Sloan griz, 2MASS JHK \textsubscript{ s }, and WISE W1W2W3. With the precision achieved we also detect a slope of absolute magnitudes{\~ } 0.020+/- 0.003 \{mag\} \{\{Gyr\}\}\textsuperscript{-1} in the infrared, implying that distance calibrations of clump stars can be off by up to{\~ } 0.2 \{mag\} in the infrared (over the range from 2 to 12 Gyr) if their ages are unknown. Even larger uncertainties affect optical bands, because of the stronger interdependency of absolute magnitudes on colors and age. Our distance calibrations are ultimately based on asteroseismology, and we show how the distance scale can be used to test the accuracy of seismic scaling relations. Within the uncertainties our calibrations are in agreement with those built upon local red clumps with Hipparcos parallaxes, although we find a tension, which, if confirmed, would imply that scaling relations overestimate the radii of red clump stars by 2 {$\pm$} 2\%. Data releases post Gaia DR1 will provide an important testbed for our results.},

We obtained interferometric observations for three RGB stars with the MIRC instrument mounted at the CHARA interfer- ometer. We looked for asymmetries on the stellar surfaces using limb-darkening models. Results. We measured the apparent diameters of HD197989 (Epsilon Cyg) = 4.61+-0.02 mas, HD189276 (HR7633) = 2.95+-0.01 mas, and HD161096 (Beta Oph) = 4.43+-0.01 mas. We detected departures from the centrosymmetric case for all three stars with the tendency of a greater effect for lower logg of the sample. We explored the causes of this signal and conclude that a possible explanation to the interferometric signal is the convection-related and/or the magnetic-related surface activity. However, it is necessary to monitor these stars with new observations, possibly coupled with spectroscopy, in order to firmly establish the cause.},

  abstract = {The effective temperature (Teff) distribution of stellar evolution models along the red giant branch (RGB) is sensitive to a number of parameters including the overall metallicity, elemental abundance patterns, the efficiency of convection, and the treatment of the surface boundary condition. Recently there has been interest in using observational estimates of the RGB Teff to place constraints on the mixing length parameter, a\_MLT, and possible variation with metallicity. Here we use 1D MESA stellar evolution models to explore the sensitivity of the RGB Teff to the treatment of the surface boundary condition. We find that different surface boundary conditions can lead to +/- 100 K metallicity-dependent offsets on the RGB relative to one another in spite of the fact that all models can reproduce the properties of the Sun. Moreover, for a given atmosphere T-tau relation, we find that the RGB Teff is also sensitive to the optical depth at which the surface boundary condition is applied in the stellar model. Nearly all models adopt the photosphere as the location of the surface boundary condition but this choice is somewhat arbitrary. We compare our models to stellar parameters derived from the APOGEE-Kepler sample of first ascent red giants and find that systematic uncertainties in the models due to treatment of the surface boundary condition place a limit of \textasciitilde 100 K below which it is not possible to make firm conclusions regarding the fidelity of the current generation of stellar models.},

  abstract = {Data from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) project and other helioseismic experiments provide a test for models of stellar interiors and for the thermodynamic and radiative properties, on which the models depend, of matter under the extreme conditions found in the sun. Current models are in agreement with the helioseismic inferences, which
suggests, for example, that the disagreement between the predicted and observed fluxes of neutrinos from the sun is not caused by errors in the models. However, the GONG data reveal subtle errors in the models, such as an excess in sound speed just beneath the convection zone. These discrepancies indicate effects that have so far not been correctly accounted for; for example, it is plausible that the sound-speed differences reflect weak mixing in stellar interiors, of potential importance to the overall evolution of stars and ultimately to estimates of the age of the galaxy based on stellar evolution calculations.},

substantial accuracy. In addition, information is emerging about the complex subsurface structure and dynamics of sunspot regions, which dominate the magnetic activity in the solar atmosphere and beyond. The results provide a detailed test of the modeling of stellar structure and evolution, and hence of the physical properties of matter assumed in the models. In this way the basis for using stellar modeling in other branches of science is substantially strengthened; an important example is the use of observations of solar neutrinos to constrain the

We are able to recover gyrochronological ages for old, lower-main-sequence stars, a remarkable improvement over prior work in hotter stars. Under our model assumptions, our ages have a median relative uncertainty of \$14\textbackslash\%\$, comparable to the age precision inferred for more massive stars using traditional methods. We investigate trends of galactic \$\textbackslash alpha\$-enhancement with age, finding evidence of a detection threshold between the age of the oldest \$\textbackslash alpha\$-poor stars and that of the bulk \$\textbackslash alpha\$-rich population. We argue that gyrochronology is an effective tool reaching ages of 10--12 Gyr in K- and early M-dwarfs.

  abstract = {The abundance and narrow magnitude dispersion of Red Clump (RC) stars make them a popular candidate for mapping the morphology of the bulge region of the Milky Way. Using a semi-analytic derivation of the RC's intrinsic luminosity function, we extracted the three-dimensional density distribution of the RC from deep photometric catalogues of the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey. We employed a joint approach of parametric modelling and maximum entropy based non-parametric deconvolution to extract the spatial distribution of the bulge from Ks-band star counts. Assuming two-fold symmetry over the Galactic plane, we obtained our non-parametric model of the bulge over the inner 40 by 40 degrees squared region centred on the Galactic centre with curvature minimising inpainting overcrowded and high extinction regions. Our reconstruction also naturally matches onto a parametric fit to the bulge outside the VVV region. We incorporated into our background model an apparent feature behind the bar previously observed in the VVV survey. We found a range of bulge properties consistent with other recent investigations based on the VVV data. However, our base model does have less dense X-arms than previous analysis and also retains an asymmetry between the near and far arms of the X-bulge. Studies of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray Galactic centre excess suggest that the excess may be traced by Galactic Bulge distributed sources. Building on the view that the RC sufficiently traces the Galactic bulge morphology, we applied our deconvolved density in a template fitting analysis of this Fermi-LAT GeV excess and found an improvement in the fit compared to previous parametric based templates.},

These peaks result from ellipsoidal variations which are indicative of binary star systems, at frequencies such that the orbit of any stellar companion would be within the convective envelope of the red giant. Alternatively, the observed phenomenon may be due to a close binary orbiting a red giant in a triple system, or chance alignments of foreground or background binary systems contaminating the target pixel aperture. We identify 87 stars in the sample as chance alignments using a combination of pixel Fourier analysis and difference imaging. We find that in the remaining 81 cases the anomalous peaks are indistinguishable from the target star to within 4\$''\$, suggesting a physical association. We examine a Galaxia model of the \$Kepler\$ field of view to estimate background star counts and find that it is highly unlikely that all targets can be explained by chance alignments.

We applied the code to the peak bagging analysis of solar-like oscillations observed in a
challenging F-type star. By means of DIAMONDS one is able to detect the different backgrounds in the power spectrum of the star (e.g. stellar granulation and faculae activity) and to understand whether one or two oscillation peaks can be identified or not. In addition, we demonstrate a novel approach to peak bagging based on multi-modality, which is able to reduce significantly the number of free parameters involved in the peak bagging model. This novel approach is therefore of great interest for possible future automatization of the entire analysis technique.

The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft has allowed astrophysicists to achieve a major breakthrough in the knowledge of the solar core. Both GOLF and MDI instruments on SOHO have significantly improved the accuracy of the sound speed profile, mainly by the detection of low-degree low-order p-modes. Our study
(Turck-Chi\`eze and coworkers) has lead to precise neutrino
predictions through constructing a seismic solar model that is in good agreement with the sound speed profile inferred by helioseismology in the radiative interior of the Sun. In this paper we present the details of this study and investigate new solar models validated by the acoustic modes. These new models are primarily used to derive the emitted neutrino fluxes. We show that these fluxes do not depend strongly on the modified physics as far as the model is consistent with the helioseismic observations in the core. We also show that an internal large-scale magnetic field cannot exceed a maximum strength of
\textasciitilde =3\texttimes 107 G in the radiative zone and may increase the
emitted 8B neutrino flux only by \textasciitilde =2\%. All the neutrino predictions here are compatible with the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory results, assuming three neutrino flavors. We deduce the electron and neutron radial densities that are needed to calculate the neutrino oscillation properties. Finally, we discuss how the magnetic fields may influence the neutrino transport through the RSFP process, for different values of {$\Delta$}m2.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope yielded unprecedented data for the study of 
solar-like oscillations in other stars. The large samples of multi-year
observations posed an enormous data analysis challenge that has only
recently been surmounted. Asteroseismic modeling has become more
sophisticated over time, with better methods gradually developing
alongside the extended observations and improved data analysis
techniques. We apply the latest version of the Asteroseismic Modeling
Portal (AMP) to the full-length Kepler data sets for 57 stars,
comprising planetary hosts, binaries, solar-analogs, active stars, and
for validation purposes, the Sun. From an analysis of the derived
stellar properties for the full sample, we identify a variation of the
mixing-length parameter with atmospheric properties. We also derive a
linear relation between the stellar age and a characteristic frequency
separation ratio. In addition, we find that the empirical correction for
surface effects suggested by Kjeldsen and coworkers is adequate for
solar-type stars that are not much hotter (Teff{$\lessequivlnt$}6200 K)
or significantly more evolved (log g{$\greaterequivlnt$}4.2, {$\langle$} {$\Delta\nu$}
{$\rangle\greaterequivlnt$}80 {$\mu$}Hz) than the Sun. Precise parallaxes from the Gaia
mission and future observations from TESS and PLATO promise to improve
the reliability of stellar properties derived from asteroseismology.

  abstract = {The masses, atmospheric makeups, spin-orbit alignments, and system architectures of extrasolar planets can be best studied when the planets orbit bright stars. We report the discovery of three bodies orbiting HD 106315, a bright (V = 8.97 mag) F5 dwarf targeted by our K2 survey for transiting exoplanets. Two small, transiting planets have radii of 2.23 (+0.30/-0.25) R\_Earth and 3.95 (+0.42/-0.39) R\_Earth and orbital periods of 9.55 d and 21.06 d, respectively. A radial velocity (RV) trend of 3.55 +/- 0.10 m/s/day indicates the presence of a third body orbiting HD 106315 with period {$>$}80 d and mass {$>$}M\_Jup. Transits of this object would have depths of \textasciitilde 1\% and are definitively ruled out. Though the star has v sin i=13.2 km/s, it exhibits short-timescale RV variability of just 6.4 m/s, and so is a good target for RV measurements of the mass and density of the inner two planets and the outer object's orbit and mass. Furthermore, the combination of RV jitter and moderate v sin i makes HD 106315 a valuable laboratory for studying the spin-orbit alignment of small planets through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Space-based atmospheric characterization of the two transiting planets via transit and eclipse spectroscopy should also be feasible. This discovery demonstrates again the power of K2 to find compelling exoplanets worthy of future study.},

  abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (\$\textbackslash leq\$1 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$). Unfortunately, rotation period \$(P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\})\$ measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\} \textbackslash propto \textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash rm age\}\$): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag\textbackslash "ueros et al. (2018) interpreted data for the \$\textbackslash approx\$1.4-Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\}\$ stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the \$\textbackslash approx\$1-Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\}\$ for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from \$\textbackslash approx\$0.8 to \$\textbackslash approx\$0.6 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04\$\textbackslash pm\$0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-\$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\}\$ sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} \textbackslash approx 4295\$ K (K5V, 0.7 \$M\_\textbackslash odot\$), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\}\$ for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where \$P\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\}\$ stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

  abstract = {We present ground-based observations from the Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) of three transits of Kepler-445c---a supposed super-Earth exoplanet with properties resembling GJ 1214b---and demonstrate that the transit depth is approximately 50 percent shallower than the depth previously inferred from Kepler Spacecraft data. The resulting decrease in planetary radius significantly alters the interpretation of the exoplanet's bulk composition. Despite the faintness of the M4 dwarf host star, our ground-based photometry clearly recovers each transit and achieves repeatable 1-sigma precision of approximately 0.2 percent (2 millimags). The transit parameters estimated from the DCT data are discrepant with those inferred from the Kepler data to at least 17-sigma confidence. This inconsistency is due to a subtle miscalculation of the stellar crowding metric during the Kepler pre-search data conditioning (PDC). The crowding metric, or CROWDSAP, is contaminated by a non-existent "phantom star" originating in the USNO-B1 catalog and inherited by the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). Phantom stars in the KIC are likely rare, but they have the potential to affect statistical studies of Kepler targets that use the PDC transit depths for a large number of exoplanets where individual follow-up observation of each is not possible. The miscalculation of Kepler-445c's transit depth emphasizes the importance of stellar crowding in the Kepler data, and provides a cautionary tale for the analysis of data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which will have even larger pixels than Kepler.},

To fully analyse these data for the tens of thousands of stars observed by Kepler, automated methods are a prerequisite. Here, we present an automated procedure to determine the period spacing of gravity modes in red giant stars ascending the red giant branch. The gravity modes reside in a cavity in the deep interior of the stars and provide information on the conditions in the stellar core. However, for red giants the gravity modes are not directly observable on the surface, hence this method is based on the pressure-gravity mixed modes that present observable features in the Fourier power spectrum. The method presented here is based on the vertical alignment and symmetry of these mixed modes in a period echelle diagram. We find that we can obtain reliable results for both model frequencies and observed frequencies. Additionally, we carried out Monte Carlo tests to obtain realistic uncertainties on the period spacings with different set of oscillation modes (for the models) and uncertainties on the frequencies. Furthermore, this method has been used to improve mode detection and identification of the observed frequencies in an iterative manner.},

We utilize a sample of 347 stars with robust flare activity detections and which have rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their Kepler light curves. We consider three separate methods for quantifying flare activity from optical light curves and compare their utility for comparing flare activity between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include the fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution (FFD). With all three approaches, we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass stars as they spin down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change in the power-law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed of younger, more active stars, our model overpredicts the superflare rate previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model of the FFD for ease in predicting the rates of flares and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection.},

The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by McQuillan et al. (2013), is clearly recovered for stars out to 525pc, but is not detectable at further distances. This bimodality correlates with Galactic height as well, dropping strongly for stars above Z\&gt;90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of \$\textbackslash Delta M\_G\$ \textasciitilde 0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient suggests that main sequence evolution produces offsets in color-magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.},

to maximize the potential science that can be performed with the BiSON
data set by optimizing the calibration procedure. To achieve better
levels of signal-to-noise ratio, we perform two key steps in the
calibration process: we attempt a correction for terrestrial atmospheric
differential extinction; and the resulting improvement in the
calibration allows us to perform weighted averaging of contemporaneous
data from different BiSON stations. The improvements listed produce
significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the BiSON
frequency-power spectrum across all frequency ranges. The reduction of
noise in the power spectrum will allow future work to provide greater
constraint on changes in the oscillation spectrum with solar activity.
In addition, the analysis of the low-frequency region suggests that we
have achieved a noise level that may allow us to improve estimates of
the upper limit of g-mode amplitudes.},

We begin by discussing the planet-planet interactions that take place within our own Solar System. We then describe such interactions in more tightly-packed planetary systems. As planet-planet interactions build up, some systems become dynamically unstable, leading to strong encounters and ultimately either ejections or collisions of planets. After discussing the basic physical processes involved, we consider how these interactions apply to extrasolar planetary systems and explore the constraints provided by observed systems. The presence of a residual planetesimal disc can lead to planetary migration and hence cause instabilities induced by resonance crossing; however, such discs can also stabilise planetary systems. The crowded birth environment of a planetary system can have a significant impact: close encounters and binary companions can act to destabilise systems, or sculpt their properties. In the case of binaries, the Kozai mechanism can place planets on extremely eccentric orbits which may later circularise to produce hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {Recent results have suggested that there is tension between the Gaia DR1 TGAS distances and the distances obtained using luminosities determined by eclipsing binaries or asteroseismology on red giant stars. We use the K\textsubscript{s}-band luminosities of red clump stars, identified and characterized by asteroseismology, to make independent distance estimates. Our results suggest that Gaia TGAS distances contain a systematic error that decreases with increasing distance. We propose a correction to mitigate this offset as a function of parallax that is valid for the Kepler field and values of parallax that are less than 1.6 mas. For parallaxes greater than this, we find agreement with previously published values. We note that the TGAS distances to the red clump stars of the open cluster M67 show a high level of disagreement that is difficult to correct for.},

Here we look at the information content in data sets representing current and future space missions (CoRoT, Kepler, K2, TESS, and PLATO) for red giant stars. We describe techniques for extracting the information in the frequency power spectrum and apply these techniques to Kepler data sets of different observing length to represent the different space missions. We demonstrate that for KIC 12008916, a low-luminosity red giant branch star, we can extract useful information from all data sets, and for all but the shortest data set we obtain good constraint on the g-mode period spacing and core rotation rates. We discuss how the high precision in these parameters will constrain the stellar properties of stellar radius, distance, mass and age. We show that high precision can be achieved in mass and hence age when values of the g-mode period spacing are available. We caution that tests to establish the accuracy of asteroseismic masses and ages are still ``work in progress''.},

This will be achieved by asteroseismology. It is important in this context to test the influence on the derived parameters of introducing atomic diffusion with radiative accelerations in the models. In this paper, we begin this study with the case of the star 94 Ceti A. We performed a complete asteroseismic analysis of the exoplanet-host F-type star 94 Ceti A, from the first radial-velocity observations with HARPS up to the final computed best models. This star is hot enough to suffer from important effects of atomic diffusion, including radiative accelerations. We tested the influence of such effects on the computed frequencies and on the determined stellar parameters. We also tested the effect of including a complete atmosphere in the stellar models. The radial velocity observations were done with HARPS in 2007. The low degree modes were derived and identified using classical methods and compared with the results obtained from stellar models computed with the Toulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC). We obtained precise parameters for the star 94 Ceti A. We showed that including atomic diffusion with radiative accelerations can modify the age by a few percents, whereas adding a complete atmosphere does not change the results by more than one percent.},

  abstract = {Rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and the evolution of stars. However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in stars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in stellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we desperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars, which until very recently was restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report the detection of mixed modes\textemdash i.e., modes that behave both as g modes in the core and as p modes in the envelope\textemdash in the spectrum of the early red giant KIC 7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By performing an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that its non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to determine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a stellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic properties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal rotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the star is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed new light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In particular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular momentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which could help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over the last few decades.},

  abstract = {Context. We still do not understand which physical mechanisms are responsible for the transport of angular momentum inside stars. The recent detection of mixed modes that contain the clear signature of rotation in the spectra of Kepler subgiants and red giants gives us the opportunity to make progress on this question. \\
 Aims: Our aim is to probe the radial dependence of the rotation profiles for a sample of Kepler targets. For this purpose, subgiants and early red giants are particularly interesting targets because their rotational splittings are more sensitive to the rotation outside the deeper core than is the case for their more evolved counterparts. \\
 Methods: We first extracted the rotational splittings and frequencies of the modes for six young Kepler red giants. We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted the internal rotation profiles of the six stars. \\
 Results: We obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that contract from those that expand. \\
 Conclusions: We characterized the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant branches.

  abstract = {4MOST is a wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic survey facility under development for the VISTA telescope of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). Its main science drivers are in the fields of galactic archeology, high-energy physics, galaxy evolution and
cosmology. 4MOST will in particular provide the spectroscopic
complements to the large area surveys coming from space missions like Gaia, eROSITA, Euclid, and PLATO and from ground-based facilities like VISTA, VST, DES, LSST and SKA. The 4MOST baseline concept features a 2.5 degree diameter field-of-view with \textasciitilde 2400 fibres in the focal surface that are configured by a fibre positioner based on the tilting spine principle. The fibres feed two types of spectrographs; \textasciitilde 1600 fibres go to two spectrographs with resolution R{$<$}5000 ({$\lambda\sptilde$}390-930 nm) and
\textasciitilde 800 fibres to a spectrograph with R{$>$}18,000 ({$\lambda\sptilde$}392-437 nm and
515-572 nm and 605-675 nm). Both types of spectrographs are
fixed-configuration, three-channel spectrographs. 4MOST will have an unique operations concept in which 5 year public surveys from both the consortium and the ESO community will be combined and observed in parallel during each exposure, resulting in more than 25 million spectra of targets spread over a large fraction of the southern sky. The 4MOST Facility Simulator (4FS) was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of this observing concept. 4MOST has been accepted for implementation by ESO with operations expected to start by the end of 2020. This paper provides a top-level overview of the 4MOST facility, while other papers in these proceedings provide more detailed descriptions of the
instrument concept[1], the instrument requirements development[2], the systems engineering implementation[3], the instrument model[4], the fibre positioner concepts[5], the fibre feed[6], and the

  abstract = {The atmospheres of exoplanets reveal all their properties beyond mass, radius, and orbit. Based on bulk densities, we know that exoplanets larger than 1.5 Earth radii must have gaseous envelopes, hence atmospheres. We discuss contemporary techniques for characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres. The measurements are difficult, because - even in current favorable cases - the signals can be as small as 0.001-percent of the host star's flux. Consequently, some early results have been illusory, and not confirmed by subsequent investigations. Prominent illusions to date include polarized scattered light, temperature inversions, and the existence of carbon planets. The field moves from the first tentative and often incorrect conclusions, converging to the reality of exoplanetary atmospheres. That reality is revealed using transits for close-in exoplanets, and direct imaging for young or massive exoplanets in distant orbits. Several atomic and molecular constituents have now been robustly detected in exoplanets as small as Neptune. In our current observations, the effects of clouds and haze appear ubiquitous. Topics at the current frontier include the measurement of heavy element abundances in giant planets, detection of carbon-based molecules, measurement of atmospheric temperature profiles, definition of heat circulation efficiencies for tidally locked planets, and the push to detect and characterize the atmospheres of super-Earths. Future observatories for this quest include the James Webb Space Telescope, and the new generation of Extremely Large Telescopes on the ground. On a more distant horizon, NASA's concepts for the HabEx and LUVOIR missions could extend the study of exoplanetary atmospheres to true twins of Earth.},

  abstract = {Towards the end of their lives, stars like the Sun greatly expand to become red giant stars. Such evolved stars could provide stringent tests of stellar theory, as many uncertainties of the internal stellar structure accumulate with age. Important examples are convective overshooting and rotational mixing during the central hydrogen-burning phase, which determine the mass of the helium core, but which are not well understood. In principle, analysis of radial and non-radial stellar oscillations can be used to constrain the mass of the helium core. Although all giants are expected to oscillate, it has hitherto been unclear whether non-radial modes are observable at all in red giants, or whether the oscillation modes have a short or a long mode lifetime, which determines the observational precision of the frequencies. Here we report the presence of radial and non-radial oscillations in more than 300 giant stars. For at least some of the giants, the mode lifetimes are of the order of a month. We observe giant stars with equally spaced frequency peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the time series, as well as giants for which the spectrum seems to be more complex.

Using a Bayesian analysis that combines asteroseismic techniques and additional ground-based observations, the mass, radius, luminosity, and distance of these stars can be estimated with good precision. This has given a new impetus to the research field of galactic archeology. \\
 Aims: The first data release of the Gaia space mission contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue with parallax estimates for more than 2 million stars, including many of the Kepler targets. Our goal is to make a first proper comparison of asteroseismic and astrometric parallaxes of a selection of dwarfs, subgiants, and red giants observed by Kepler for which asteroseismic distances were published. \\
 Methods: We compare asteroseismic and astrometric distances of solar-like pulsators using an appropriate statistical errors-in-variables model on a linear and on a logarithmic scale. \\
 Results: For a sample of 22 dwarf and subgiant solar-like oscillators, the TGAS parallaxes considerably improved on the Hipparcos data, yet the excellent agreement between asteroseismic and astrometric distances still holds. For a sample of 938 Kepler pulsating red giants, the TGAS parallaxes are much more uncertain than the asteroseismic ones, making it worthwhile to validate the former with the latter. From errors-in-variables modelling we find a significant discrepancy between the TGAS parallaxes and the asteroseismic values. \\
 Conclusions: For the sample of dwarfs and subgiants, the comparison between astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes does not require a revision of the stellar models on the basis of TGAS. For the sample of red giants, we identify possible causes of the discrepancy, which we will likely be able to resolve with the more precise Gaia parallaxes in the upcoming releases.},

Interestingly, the western radio relic does not entirely trace the X-ray shock. A possible explanation is that the relic traces fossil plasma from nearby radio galaxies that is reaccelerated at the shock.

The low surface brightness and reduced integration time for this region might have prevented the detection.

  abstract = {Magnetic cycles have been detected in tens of solar-like stars. The relationship between the cycle properties and global stellar parameters is not fully understood yet. We searched for activity cycles in 90 solar-like stars with ages between 4 and 95 Myr aiming to investigate the properties of activity cycles in this age range. We measured the length \$P\_\{ cyc\}\$ of a given cycle by analyzing the long-term time-series of three activity indexes. For each star, we computed also the global magnetic activity index  that is proportional to the amplitude of the rotational modulation and is a proxy of the mean level of the surface magnetic activity. We detected activity cycles in 67 stars. Secondary cycles were also detected in 32 stars. The lack of correlation between \$P\_\{ cyc\}\$ and \$P\_\{ rot\}\$ suggest that these stars belong to the Transitional Branch and that the dynamo acting in these stars is different from the solar one. This statement is also supported by the analysis of the butterfly diagrams. We computed the Spearman correlation coefficient \$r\_\{ S\}\$ between \$P\_\{ cyc\}\$,  and different stellar parameters. We found that \$P\_\{ cyc\}\$ is uncorrelated with all the investigated parameters. The  index is positively correlated with the convective turn-over time-scale, the magnetic diffusivity time-scale \$\textbackslash tau\_\{ diff\}\$, and the dynamo number \$D\_\{ N\}\$, whereas it is anti-correlated with the effective temperature \$T\_\{ eff\}\$, the photometric shear \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash Omega\_\{\textbackslash rm phot\}\$ and the radius \$R\_\{ C\}\$ at which the convective zone is located. We found that \$P\_\{ cyc\}\$ is about constant and that  decreases with the stellare age in the range 4-95 Myr. We investigated the magnetic activity of AB Dor A by merging ASAS time-series with previous long-term photometric data. We estimated the length of the AB Dor A primary cycle as \$P\_\{ cyc\} = 16.78 \textbackslash pm 2 \textbackslash rm yr\$.},

The STSP constitutes the first ``cornerstone'' of ESA's long-term programme known as ``Space Science \textemdash{} Horizon 2000''. The principal scientific objectives of the SOHO mission are a) to reach a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar interior using techniques of helioseismology, and b) to gain better insight into the physical processes that form and heat the Sun's corona, maintain it and give rise to its acceleration into the solar wind. To achieve these goals, SOHO carries a payload consisting of 12 sets of complementary instruments. SOHO is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft with a total mass of 1850 kg; 1150 W of power will be provided by the solar panels. The payload weighs about 640 kg and will consume 450 W in orbit. SOHO will be launched by an ATLAS II-AS and will be placed in a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point where it will be continuously pointing to Sun centre with an accuracy of 10 arcsec. Pointing stability will be better than 1 arcsec over 15 min intervals. The SOHO payload produces a continuous science data stream of 40 kbits/s which will be increased by 160 kbits/s whenever the solar oscillations imaging instrument is operated in its highrate mode. Telemetry will be received by NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). Planning, coordination and operation of the spacecraft and the scientific payload will be conducted from the Experiment Operations Facility (EOF) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).},

age, and can be used to investigate the connections between
angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime.
We present the results of a comparative study of the relationship
between stellar rotation and activity in two benchmark open clusters:
Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have the same age and roughly solar
metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the
agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations
at {$\approx$}600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of 720 spectra\textemdash more than
half of which are new observations\textemdash for 516 high-confidence members
of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for 130
high-confidence Hyads. We have also collected rotation periods (P
rot) for 135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare
H{$\alpha$} emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, as a function
of color, mass, and Rossby number Ro , we first calculate an
expanded set of {$\chi$} values, with which we can obtain the H{$\alpha$} to
bolometric luminosity ratio, L H{$\alpha$}/L bol,
even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable
distances. Our {$\chi$} values cover a broader range of stellar masses and
colors (roughly equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit
better agreement between independent calculations, than existing values.
Unlike previous authors, we find no difference between the two clusters
in their H{$\alpha$} equivalent width or L H{$\alpha$}/L
bol distributions, and therefore take the merged H{$\alpha$} and
P rot data to be representative of 600 Myr old stars. Our
analysis shows that H{$\alpha$} activity in these stars is saturated for
\{R\_o\}{$\leq$} 0.11+0.02-0.03. Above that value
activity declines as a power-law with slope {$\beta$}
=-0.73+0.16-0.12, before dropping off rapidly at
Ro {$\approx$} 0.4. These data provide a useful anchor for
calibrating the age-activity-rotation relation beyond 600 Myr.},

We then combine literature binary data with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry to select single star sequences in the Hyades and its roughly coeval Praesepe open cluster, and derive a new reddening value of \$A\_V = 0.035\$\$\textbackslash pm\$\$0.011\$ for Praesepe. Comparing the effective temperature--\$P\_\{rot\}\$ distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4\textasciitilde d slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This \$P\_\{rot\}\$ difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun, and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57\textasciitilde Myr. However, this \$P\_\{rot\}\$ difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars, and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular-momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages.},

calculated from 2088 day MDI, GONG, and GOLF time series that were
fitted to estimate very low frequency rotational splittings ({$\nu$} {$<$}
1.7 mHz). These low-frequency modes provide data of exceptional quality,
since the width of the mode peaks is much smaller than the rotational
splitting, and hence it is much easier to separate the rotational
splittings from the effects caused by the finite lifetime and the
stochastic excitation of the modes. We have also implemented a new
inversion methodology that allows us to infer the rotation rate of the
radiative interior from mode sets that span l = 1 to 25. Our results are
compatible with the Sun rotating like a rigid solid in most of the
radiative zone, and slowing down in the core (r/R{$\odot$} {$<$}
0.2). A resolution analysis of the inversion was carried out for the
solar rotation inverse problem. This analysis effectively establishes a
direct relationship between the mode set included in the inversion and
the sensitivity and information content of the resulting inferences. We
show that such an approach allows us to determine the effect of adding
low-frequency and low-degree p-modes, high-frequency and low-degree
p-modes, and some g-modes on the derived rotation rate in the solar
radiative zone, and in particular the solar core. We conclude that the
level of uncertainty that is needed to infer the dynamical conditions in
the core when only p-modes are included is unlikely to be reached in the
near future, and hence sustained efforts are needed toward the detection

abundances of exoplanet-host stars compared to solar-type stars without

rotational periods of solar-type stars suggest a possible link between
lithium depletion and the rotational history of exoplanet-host stars.
 Aims: The effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the surface
abundances of solar-type stars are studied in order to investigate
whether the reported difference in lithium content of exoplanet-host
stars can be related to their rotational history. Moreover, the
asteroseismic properties predicted for stars with and without exoplanets
are compared to determine how such a scenario, which relates the lithium
abundances and the rotational history of the star, can be further
challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations. Methods:
Based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow
rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) are modelled with a
comprehensive treatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast
rotators are modelled including both shellular rotation and magnetic
fields. Assuming a possible link between low rotation rates on the ZAMS
and the presence of planets as a result of a longer disc-locking phase
during the pre-main sequence (PMS), we compare the surface abundances
and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotating models, which
correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detected planets,
respectively. Results: We confirm previous suggestions that the
difference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected
planets can be related to their different rotational history. The larger
efficiency of rotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars
explains their lithium depletion and also leads to changes in the
structure and chemical composition of the central stellar layers.
Asteroseismic observations can reveal these changes and can help us
distinguish between different possible explanations for the lower
lithium content of exoplanet-host stars.},

The influence of rotational mixing on the evolution and asteroseismic
properties of solar-type stars is studied. Methods: Global and
asteroseismic properties of models of solar-type stars computed with and
without a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation are compared.
The effects of internal magnetic fields are also discussed in the
framework of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. Results: Rotational mixing
changes the global properties of a solar-type star with a significant
increase of the effective temperature resulting in a shift of the
evolutionary track to the blue part of the HR diagram. These differences
observed in the HR diagram are related to changes of the chemical
composition, because rotational mixing counteracts the effects of atomic
diffusion leading to larger helium surface abundances for rotating
models than for non-rotating ones. Higher values of the large frequency
separation are then found for rotating models than for non-rotating ones
at the same evolutionary stage, because the increase of the effective
temperature leads to a smaller radius and hence to an increase of the
stellar mean density. In addition to changing the global properties of
solar-type stars, rotational mixing also has a considerable impact on
the structure and chemical composition of the central stellar layers by
bringing fresh hydrogen fuel to the central stellar core, thereby
enhancing the main-sequence lifetime. The increase of the central
hydrogen abundance together with the change of the chemical profiles in
the central layers result in a significant increase of the values of the
small frequency separations and of the ratio of the small to large
separations for models including shellular rotation. This increase is
clearly seen for models with the same age sharing the same initial
parameters except for the inclusion of rotation as well as for models
with the same global stellar parameters and in particular the same
location in the HR diagram. By computing rotating models of solar-type
stars including the effects of a dynamo that possibly occurs in the
radiative zone, we find that the efficiency of rotational mixing is
strongly reduced when the effects of magnetic fields are taken into
account, in contrast to what happens in massive stars.},

The recent observations of solar-like oscillations in many red giant stars with the CoRoT satellite stimulated the theoretical study of the effects of various physical processes on the modelling of these stars. Aims: The influence of rotation on the properties of red giants is studied in the context of the asteroseismic modelling of these stars. Methods: The effects of rotation on the global and asteroseismic properties of red giant stars with a mass larger than the mass limit for degenerate He burning are investigated by comparing rotating models computed with a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation to non-rotating ones. Results: While red giants exhibit low surface rotational velocities, we find that the rotational history of the star has a large impact on its properties during the red giant phase. In particular, for stars massive enough to ignite He burning in non-degenerate conditions, rotational mixing induces a significant increase of the stellar luminosity and shifts the location of the core helium burning phase to a higher luminosity in the HR diagram. This of course results in a change of the seismic properties of red giants at the same evolutionary state. As a consequence the inclusion of rotation significantly changes the fundamental parameters of a red giant star as determined by performing an asteroseismic calibration. In particular rotation decreases the derived stellar mass and increases the age. Depending on the rotation law assumed in the convective envelope and on the initial velocity of the star, non-negligible values of rotational splitting can be reached, which may complicate the observation and identification of non-radial oscillation modes for red giants exhibiting moderate surface rotational velocities. By comparing the effects of rotation and overshooting, we find that the main-sequence widening and the increase of the H-burning lifetime induced by rotation
(Vini) = 150 km s-1) are well reproduced by non-rotating models with an overshooting parameter of 0.1, while the increase of luminosity during the post-main sequence evolution is better reproduced by non-rotating models with overshooting parameters twice as large. This illustrates the fact that rotation not only increases the size of the convective core but also changes the chemical composition of the radiative zone.},

  abstract = {Context: Constraints on the internal rotation of red giants are now available thanks to asteroseismic observations. Preliminary comparisons with rotating stellar models indicate that an undetermined additional process for the internal transport of angular momentum is required in addition to purely hydrodynamic processes. Aims: We investigate how asteroseismic measurements of red giants can help us characterize the additional transport mechanism. Methods: We first determine the efficiency of the missing transport mechanism for the low-mass red giant KIC 7341231 by computing rotating models that include an additional viscosity corresponding to this process. We then discuss the change in the efficiency of this transport of angular momentum with the mass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Results: In the case of the low-mass red giant KIC 7341231, we find that the viscosity corresponding to the additional mechanism is constrained to the range 1 x 10\^3 - 1.3 x 10\^4 cm\^2/s. This constraint on the efficiency of the unknown additional transport mechanism during the post-main sequence is obtained independently of any specific assumption about the modelling of rotational effects during the pre-main sequence and the main sequence (in particular, the braking of the surface by magnetized winds and the efficiency of the internal transport of angular momentum before the post-main-sequence phase). When we assume that the additional transport mechanism is at work during the whole evolution of the star together with a solar-calibrated braking of the surface by magnetized winds, the range of nu\_add is reduced to 1 - 4 x 10\^3 cm\^2/s. In addition to being sensitive to the evolutionary stage of the star, we show that the efficiency of the unknown process for internal transport of angular momentum increases with the stellar mass.},

SDSS-III is a program of four spectroscopic surveys on three scientific
themes: dark energy and cosmological parameters, the history and
structure of the Milky Way, and the population of giant planets around
other stars. In keeping with SDSS tradition, SDSS-III will provide
regular public releases of all its data, beginning with SDSS Data
Release 8 (DR8), which was made public in 2011 January and includes
SDSS-I and SDSS-II images and spectra reprocessed with the latest
pipelines and calibrations produced for the SDSS-III investigations.
This paper presents an overview of the four surveys that comprise
SDSS-III. The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey will measure
redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Ly{$\alpha$} forest spectra
of 150,000 quasars, using the baryon acoustic oscillation feature of
large-scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the
distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z {$<$} 0.7 and at z {$\approx$}
2.5. SEGUE-2, an already completed SDSS-III survey that is the
continuation of the SDSS-II Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding
and Exploration (SEGUE), measured medium-resolution (R =
{$\lambda$}/{$\Delta\lambda$} {$\approx$} 1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in
a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar
kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter
halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE, the
Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment, will obtain
high-resolution (R {$\approx$} 30,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N {$>$}=
100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51 {$\mu$}m {$<$} {$\lambda$} {$<$} 1.70
{$\mu$}m) spectra of 105 evolved, late-type stars, measuring
separate abundances for \textasciitilde 15 elements per star and creating the first
high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations
(bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and
spectral diagnostics. The Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanet
Large-area Survey (MARVELS) will monitor radial velocities of more than
8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m s-1,
\textasciitilde 24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to
two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the
formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. As of 2011
January, SDSS-III has obtained spectra of more than 240,000 galaxies,
29,000 z {$>$}= 2.2 quasars, and 140,000 stars, including 74,000 velocity
measurements of 2580 stars for MARVELS.},

constrained4-10. Observations of solar oscillation
modes have been used to probe density variations in the Sun; rotational splitting of degenerate modes, although difficult to resolve, provides important constraints on the dynamical structure11. Here we report observations of rotationally split modes made over a three-year period with the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network. Our results indicate that there is a substantial region inside the Sun that is rotating more slowly than the surface. This situation seems likely to be transient\textemdash the minimum-energy state would have all the deeper
regions rotating with the same angular velocity\textemdash and is at variance with our current ideas about the rotational evolution of main-sequence stars12. We have no solution to the dynamical problem this poses.},

  abstract = {Determining the ages of red-giant stars is a key problem in stellar astrophysics. One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the evolutionary state of the individual stars - I.e. have they started to burn Helium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data provide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is a highly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of the power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can provide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the dipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to determine some measures that are used in the categorization. It does not require that all the individual components of any given mode be separately characterized. Some 6604 red-giant stars have been classified. Of these, 3566 are determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are secondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low-metallicity, horizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondary-clump stars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We discuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead to mis-categorization in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were not classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes (so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the parameters.},

  abstract = {The rotation-mass-age relationship offers a promising avenue for measuring the ages of field stars, assuming the attendant uncertainties to this technique can be well characterized. We model stellar angular momentum evolution starting with a rotation distribution from open cluster M37. Our predicted rotation-mass-age relationship shows significant zero-point offsets compared to an alternative angular momentum loss law and published gyrochronology relations. Systematic errors at the 30\% level are permitted by current data, highlighting the need for empirical guidance. We identify two fundamental sources of uncertainty that limit the precision of rotation-based ages and quantify their impact. Stars are born with a range of rotation rates, which leads to an age range at fixed rotation period. We find that the inherent ambiguity from the initial conditions is important for all young stars, and remains large for old stars below 0.6 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. Latitudinal surface differential rotation also introduces a minimum uncertainty into rotation period measurements and, by extension, rotation-based ages. Both models and the data from binary star systems 61 Cyg and {$\alpha$} Cen demonstrate that latitudinal differential rotation is the limiting factor for rotation-based age precision among old field stars, inducing uncertainties at the \textasciitilde 2 Gyr level. We also examine the relationship between variability amplitude, rotation period, and age. Existing ground-based surveys can detect field populations with ages as old as 1-2 Gyr, while space missions can detect stars as old as the Galactic disk. In comparison with other techniques for measuring the ages of lower main sequence stars, including geometric parallax and asteroseismology, rotation-based ages have the potential to be the most precise chronometer for 0.6-1.0 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} stars.},

The method would also likely work if the stellar parameters have relatively large errors. The studies presented in the recent literature span a narrow range of [Fe/H]. By studying a larger sample of Solar neighbourhood dwarfs with a much larger range in [Fe/H], we find that the relation between [Y/Mg] and age depends on the [Fe/H] of the stars. Hence, it appears that the [Y/Mg] - age relation is unique to Solar analogues.},

rotation period (P rot) evolution of low-mass stellar
binaries up to orbital periods (P orb) of 100 days across a
wide range of tidal dissipation parameters using two common equilibrium
tidal models. We find that many binaries with P orb {$\lessequivlnt$} 20
days tidally lock, and most with P orb {$\lessequivlnt$} 4 days tidally
lock into synchronous rotation on circularized orbits. At short P
orb, tidal torques produce a population of fast rotators that
single-star-only models of magnetic braking fail to produce. In many
cases, we show that the competition between magnetic braking and tides
produces a population of subsynchronous rotators that persists for 1
Gyr, even in short-P orb binaries, qualitatively reproducing
the subsynchronous eclipsing binaries discovered in the Kepler field by
Lurie et al. Both equilibrium tidal models predict that binaries can
tidally interact out to P orb {$\approx$} 80 days, while the
constant phase lag tidal model predicts that binaries can tidally lock
out to P orb {$\approx$} 100 days. Tidal torques often force the P
rot evolution of stellar binaries to depart from the
long-term magnetic-braking-driven spin-down experienced by single stars,
revealing that P rot is not a valid proxy for age in all
cases, i.e., gyrochronology can underpredict ages by up to 300\% unless
one accounts for binarity. We suggest that accurate determinations of
orbital eccentricties and P rot can be used to discriminate
between which equilibrium tidal models best describe tidal interactions
in low-mass binary stars.},

for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even
with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of
models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales,
in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application
has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel
method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational
requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We
demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical
time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of
probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic
oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method
exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is
expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly
spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises
naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped
harmonic oscillators\textemdash providing a physical motivation for and
interpretation of this choice\textemdash but we also demonstrate that it can
be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a
mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing
scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range
of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond.
We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of
this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

  abstract = {Context. Over the past 40 years, helioseismology has been enormously successful in the study of the solar interior. A shortcoming has been the lack of a convincing detection of the solar g modes, which are oscillations driven by gravity and are hidden in the deepest part of the solar body - its hydrogen-burning core. The detection of g modes is expected to dramatically improve our ability to model this core, the rotational characteristics of which have, until now, remained unknown. Aims: We present the identification of very low frequency g modes in the asymptotic regime and two important parameters that have long been waited for: the core rotation rate, and the asymptotic equidistant period spacing of these g modes. Methods: The GOLF instrument on board the SOHO space observatory has provided two decades of full-disk helioseismic data. The search for g modes in GOLF measurements has been extremely difficult because of solar and instrumental noise. In the present study, the p modes of the GOLF signal are analyzed differently: we search for possible collective frequency modulations that are produced by periodic changes in the deep solar structure. Such
modulations provide access to only very low frequency g modes, thus allowing statistical methods to take advantage of their asymptotic properties. Results: For oscillatory periods in the range between 9 and nearly 48 h, almost 100 g modes of spherical harmonic degree 1 and more than 100 g modes of degree 2 are predicted. They are not observed individually, but when combined, they unambiguously provide their asymptotic period equidistance and rotational splittings, in excellent agreement with the requirements of the asymptotic approximations. When the period equidistance has been measured, all of the individual frequencies of each mode can be determined. Previously, p-mode
helioseismology allowed the g-mode period equidistance parameter P0 to be bracketed inside a narrow range, between
approximately 34 and 35 min. Here, P0 is measured to be 34 min 01 s, with a 1 s uncertainty. The previously unknown g-mode
splittings have now been measured from a non-synodic reference with very high accuracy, and they imply a mean weighted rotation of 1277 {$\pm$} 10 nHz (9-day period) of their kernels, resulting in a rapid rotation frequency of 1644 {$\pm$} 23 nHz (period of one week) of the solar core itself, which is a factor 3.8 {$\pm$} 0.1 faster than the rotation of
the radiative envelope. Conclusions: The g modes are known to be the keys to a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of the solar core. Their detection with these precise parameters will certainly stimulate a new era of research in this field.},

  abstract = {Context. Detached eclipsing binaries (dEBs) are ideal targets for accurately measuring the masses and radii of their component stars. If at least one of the stars has evolved off the main sequence (MS), the masses and radii give a strict constraint on the age of the stars. Several dEBs containing a bright K giant and a fainter MS star have been discovered by the Kepler satellite. The mass and radius of a red giant (RG) star can also be derived from its asteroseismic signal. The parameters determined in this way depend on stellar models and may contain systematic errors. It is important to validate the asteroseismically determined mass and radius with independent methods. This can be done when stars are members of stellar clusters or members of dEBs. \\
 Aims: This paper presents an analysis of the dEB system KIC 8410637, which consists of an RG and an MS star. The aim is to derive accurate masses and radii for both components and provide the foundation for a strong test of the asteroseismic method and the accuracy of the deduced mass, radius, and age. \\
 Methods: We analysed high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra from three different spectrographs. We also calculated a fit to the Kepler light curve and used ground-based photometry to determine the flux ratios between the component stars in the BVRI passbands. \\
 Results: We measured the masses and radii of the stars in the dEB, and the classical parameters T\textsubscript{eff}, log g, and [Fe/H] from the spectra and ground-based photometry. The RG component of KIC 8410637 is most likely in the core helium-burning red clump phase of evolution and has an age and composition that are very similar to the stars in the open cluster NGC 6819. The mass of the RG in KIC 8410637 should therefore be similar to the mass of RGs in NGC 6819, thus lending support to the latest version of the asteroseismic scaling relations. This is the first direct measurement of both mass and radius for an RG to be compared with values for RGs from asteroseismic scaling relations thereby providing an accurate comparison. We find excellent agreement between log g values derived from the binary analysis and asteroseismic scaling relations. \\
 Conclusions: We have determined the masses and radii of the two stars in the binary accurately. A detailed asteroseismic analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper, allowing an informative comparison between the parameters determined for the dEB and from asteroseismology.

These predictions are in agreement with our knowledge of stellar physics (e.g. energy transfer in strong magnetic field regions of the solar photosphere), but have yet to be directly confirmed from white dwarf observations. We obtained COS far-UV spectroscopy of the weakly magnetic, hydrogen-atmosphere, white dwarf WD2105-820 and of three additional non-magnetic, convective remnants (all in the \$T\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\}\$ range 9000-11,000 K).

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler mission is providing basic asteroseismic data for hundreds of stars. One of the more common ways of determining stellar characteristics from these data is by the so-called grid-based modeling. We have made a detailed study of grid-based analysis techniques to study the errors (and error correlations) involved. As had been reported earlier, we find that it is relatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-based techniques. However, we find that there are small, but significant, biases that can result because of the grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if metallicity is known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii and suffer from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass and radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is that log g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematic biases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence to within 5\% for realistic estimates of errors in asteroseismic and conventional observations. Errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity estimates are available. Age estimates of individual stars are the most model dependent. The errors are larger, too. However, we find that for star clusters, it is possible to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars in a given cluster have the same age.},

We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1 consists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of \textasciitilde 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of \textasciitilde 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of \textasciitilde 94000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is \textasciitilde 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to \textasciitilde 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

planetary companion (with a periods of few days or less), which could have been strongly impacted the rotational evolution of the host star, along the stellar evolution, through the star-planet tidal interaction. We showed that the interaction of a close-in massive planet with its host star can strongly modify the surface rotation rate of this latter, in most of the cases associated to a planetary engulfment. In such cases, a gyrochronology analysis of the star would wrongly make it appear as "rejuvenated", thus preventing us to use this method with confidence. To try overcome this issue, we eventually proposed the proof of concept of a new age determination technique that we call the tidal-chronology, which is based on the observed couple \$\textbackslash rm

gyrochronology technique can only be applied to isolated star or star-planet systems outside a specific range of \$\textbackslash rm P\_\{rot,\textbackslash star\}\$-\$\textbackslash rm P\_\{orb\}\$. This region tends to expand for increasing stellar and planetary mass. In that forbidden region, or if any planetary engulfment is suspected, gyrochronology should be used with extreme caution while tidal-chronology could be considered. While this technique does not provide a precise age for the system yet, it is already an extension of gyrochronology and could be helpful to determine a more precise range of possible age for planetary system composed of a star between 0.3 and 1.2 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and a planet more massive than 1 \$\textbackslash rm M\_\{jup\}\$ initially located at few hundredth au of the host star.},

  abstract = {In the modern era of helioseismology we have a wealth of high-quality data available, e.g., more than 6 years of data collected by the various instruments on board the SOHO mission, and an even more extensive ground-based set of observations covering a full solar cycle. Thanks to this effort a detailed picture of the internal rotation of the Sun has been constructed. In this paper we present some of the actions that should be done to improve our knowledge of the inner rotation profile discussed during the workshop organized at Saclay on June 2003 on this topic. In particular we will concentrate on the extraction of the rotational frequency splittings of low- and medium-degree modes and their influence on the rotation of deeper layers. Furthermore, for the first time a full set of individual |m|-component rotational splittings is computed for modes {$\mathscr{l}\leq$}4 and 1{$<\nu<$}2 mHz, opening new
studies on the latitudinal dependence of the rotation rate in the radiative interior. It will also be shown that these splittings have the footprints of the differential rotation of the convective zone which can be extremely useful to study the differential rotation of other stars where only these low-degree modes will be available.},

{$\odot$} thanks to the study of acoustic modes. Since the radius
of the inner turning point of a resonant acoustic mode is inversely
proportional to the ratio of its frequency to its degree, only the
low-degree p modes reach the core. The higher the order of these modes,
the deeper they penetrate into the Sun and thus they carry more
diagnostic information on the inner regions. Unfortunately, the
estimates of frequency splittings at high frequency from Sun-as-a-star
measurements have higher observational errors because of mode blending,
resulting in weaker constraints on the rotation profile in the inner
core. Therefore inversions for the solar internal rotation use only
modes below 2.4 mHz for {$\mathscr{l}\leq$}3. In the work presented here, we used
an 11.5-year-long time series to compute the rotational frequency
splittings for modes {$\mathscr{l}\leq$}3 using velocities measured with the GOLF
instrument. We carried out a theoretical study of the influence of the
low-degree modes in the region from 2 to 3.5 mHz on the inferred
rotation profile as a function of their error bars.},

  abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the main-sequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. General photometric levels of magnetic activity in this sample of stars were also extracted by using a photometric activity index, which takes into account the rotation period of the stars. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.

continuous ultra high-precision photometry have been obtained reaching a duty cycle higher than 90\% for many of these stars. However, almost regular gaps due to nominal operations are present in the light curves on different time scales. Aims: In this paper we want to
highlight the impact of those regular gaps in asteroseismic analyses, and we try to find a method that minimizes their effect on the frequency domain. Methods: To do so, we isolate the two main time scales of quasi regular gaps in the data. We then interpolate the gaps and compare the power density spectra of four different stars: two red giants at different stages of their evolution, a young F-type star, and a
classical pulsator in the instability strip. Results: The spectra obtained after filling the gaps in the selected solar-like stars show a net reduction in the overall background level, as well as a change in the background parameters. The inferred convective properties could change as much as \textasciitilde 200\% in the selected example, introducing a bias in the p-mode frequency of maximum power. When asteroseismic scaling relations are used, this bias can lead to a variation in the surface gravity of 0.05 dex. Finally, the oscillation spectrum in the classical pulsator is cleaner than the original one.},

However, in the last thirty years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

Observations of open clusters have revealed a bimodal distribution of the rotation periods of solar-like stars that has proven difficult to explain under the existing rubric of magnetic braking. Recent studies suggest that magnetic complexity can play an important role in controlling stellar spin-down rates. However, magnetic morphology is still neglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly accounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. Using state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the effect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of geometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates. Angular momentum loss rates depend strongly on the level of complexity of the field but are independent of the way this complexity is distributed. We deduce the analytical terms representing the magnetic field morphology dependence of mass and angular momentum loss rates. We also define a parameter that best represents complexity for real stars. As a test, we use these analytical methods to estimate mass and angular momentum loss rates for \$8\$ stars with observed magnetograms and compare them to the simulated results. Magnetic field complexity provides a natural physical basis for stellar rotation evolution models requiring a rapid transition between weak and strong spin-down modes.},

Detailed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stellar wind simulations have demonstrated that surface magnetic field morphology has a strong influence on wind-driven angular momentum loss. Observations suggest that faster rotating stars store a larger fraction of their magnetic flux in higher-order multipolar components of the magnetic field. In this work, we present an entirely predictive new model for stellar spin-down that accounts for the stellar surface magnetic field configuration. We show how a magnetic complexity that evolves from complex toward simple configurations as a star spins down can explain the salient features of stellar rotation evolution, including the bimodal distribution of both slow and fast rotators seen in young OCs.

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric dynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe et al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present the first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements. Beyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see a star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which consists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude "nu\_max" and the mean frequency separation between mode overtones "Delta nu", is surprising as the nu\_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the accepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu\_max\_sun = 3100 muHz, the asteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear larger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 \% and 4.3 +/- 1.9 \% respectively. The higher nu\_max is caused by a combination of the value of nu\_max\_sun, being larger at the time of observations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10 muHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than VIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we model ten overtones for degrees l=0,1,2. We compare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON velocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes mostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few peaks with lowest SNR.},

From several powerful validation techniques, all indications so far show that stellar radius estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate to within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for validating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining radial velocity (RV) measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year RV survey performed with the \'echelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5 m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants (RGs) obtained by combining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling relations overestimate RG radii by about 5\% on average and masses by about 15\% for stars at various stages of RG evolution. Systematic overestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies. As part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of RGs in close binaries can be suppressed enough to be undetectable, a hypothesis that was proposed in a previous work.},

  abstract = {Red giant stars are solar-like pulsators presenting mixed-modes. Such modes consist in a coupling between pressure waves propagating in the external convective envelope and gravity waves propagating in the radiative interior. Therefore, the red giant asteroseismology provides us with a direct view on their core and opens the possibility to monitor the evolution of their core rotation. Previous measurements of the mean core rotation revealed that angular momentum is efficiently transferred from the core to the envelope inside red giants, but the physical mechanisms at work are not yet fully understood. We thus need stronger observational constraints on the evolution of the red giant core rotation. In this context, we developed an automated method to determine the mean core rotation of red giant branch stars observed with Kepler. This automated method is paving the way for the future PLATO data, representing hundreds of thousands of potential red giant oscillation spectra. Results obtained for almost 1200 red giant branch stars indicate that the rate of the core rotation braking is lower than previously estimated and does not seem to depend on the stellar mass.},

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {Context. The details of the C/O core structure in white dwarf stars has mostly remained inaccessible to the technique of asteroseismology, despite several attempts carried out in the past. Aims. We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical stratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools recently developed for that purpose. Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for the core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations typical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of observed independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars. Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical stratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions expected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the significant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping) effects. These effects are similar to the well known trapping induced by the shallower chemical transitions at the edge of the core and at the bottom of the H-rich envelope. We also find that success to unravel the core structure depends on the information content of the available seismic data. In some cases, it may not be possible to isolate a unique, well-defined seismic solution and the problem remains degenerate. Conclusions. Our results establish that constraining the core chemical stratification in white dwarf stars based solely on asteroseismology is possible, an opportunity that we have started to exploit.},

A milestone was recently achieved with the detection of three Earth-sized planets transiting (i.e. passing in front of) a star just 8\% the mass of the Sun 12 parsecs away. Indeed, the transiting configuration of these planets with the Jupiter-like size of their host star - named TRAPPIST-1 - makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with current and future astronomical facilities. Here we report the results of an intensive photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to the Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.21, 12.35 days) are near ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inward. The seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible liquid water on their surfaces.},

  abstract = {The red giant clump has been recently argued to be a reliable distance indicator for the galaxies in the Local Group. The accuracy of distance determinations based on this method, however, depends on the possible presence of systematic magnitude differences ({$\increment$}MIRC) between the local clump revealed by the Hipparcos colour-magnitude diagram (CMD), and the clump stars observed in distant galaxies. In this paper, we re-address the problem of these systematic `population' effects. First, we present tables with the theoretically predicted I-band clump magnitude as a function of age and metallicity. Simple equations, taken from basic population synthesis theory, are provided for the easy computation of the mean clump magnitude for any given galaxy model. We use our models to explain in some detail what determines the distribution of masses, ages and metallicities of clump stars in a galaxy. Such an approach has so far been neglected in the analysis of clump data related with distance determinations. We point out that, in galaxies with recent/ongoing star formation (e.g. the discs of spirals), the age distribution of clump stars is strongly biased towards younger (\textasciitilde 1-3Gyr) ages, and hence towards higher metallicities. Obviously, this does not happen in galaxies with predominantly old stellar populations (e.g. ellipticals and bulges). We construct detailed models for the clump population in the local (Hipparcos) sample, the bulge, Magellanic Clouds and Carina dSph galaxy. In all cases, star formation rates and chemical enrichment histories are taken from the literature. The Hipparcos model is shown to produce distributions of metallicities, colours, and magnitudes, that are similar to those derived from spectroscopic and Hipparcos data. The bulge, Magellanic Clouds, and Carina dSph models are used to analyse the values of {$\increment$}MIRC for these different stellar systems. We show how the clump-RR Lyrae data from Udalski are well reproduced by the models. However, despite the similarity between the models and data, the models indicate that the linear {$\increment$}MIRC versus [Fe/H] relations that have been derived from the same data (such as by Udalski and Popowski) are not general. In fact, the distribution of clump stars has several factors hidden in it - e.g. the age-metallicity relation, the rate of past star formation - that cannot be described by such relations. The model behaviour is also supported by empirical data for open clusters by Sarajedini and Twarog et al. We argue that Udalski's data for Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters do not allow a good assessment of the age dependence of the clump magnitude. Moreover, we remark that similar analyses of cluster data should better include clump stars with ages 1-2Gyr, which turn out to be very important in determining the mean clump in galaxies with recent star formation. Finally, we provide revised clump distances to the bulge, Magellanic Clouds and Carina dSph, and further comment on their reliability. The largest {$\increment$}MIRC values are found for the Magellanic Clouds and Carina dSph, which turn out to be located at distance moduli \textasciitilde 0.2-0.3mag longer than indicated by works which ignore population effects. The Galactic bulge, instead, may be slightly closer (up to 0.1mag in distance modulus) than indicated by previous works based on the red clump, the exact result depending on the use of either scaled-solar or {$\alpha$}-enhanced stellar models.},

  abstract = {Based on the results of detailed population synthesis models, Girardi et al. recently claimed that the clump of red giants in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of composite stellar populations should present an extension to lower luminosities, which goes down to about 0.4mag below the main clump. This feature is made of stars just massive enough to have ignited helium in non-degenerate conditions, and therefore corresponds to a limited interval of stellar masses and ages. In the present models, which include moderate convective overshooting, it corresponds to \textasciitilde 1Gyr old populations. In this paper, we go into more detail about the origin and properties of this feature. We first compare the clump theoretical models with data for clusters of different ages and metallicities, basically confirming the predicted behaviour. We then refine the previous models in order to show the following behaviour. (i) The faint extension is expected to be clearly separated from the main clump in the CMD of metal-rich populations, defining a `secondary clump' by itself. (ii) It should be present in all galactic fields containing \textasciitilde 1Gyr old stars and with mean metallicities higher than about Z=0.004. (iii) It should be particularly strong, if compared with the main red clump, in galaxies that have increased their star formation rate in the last Gyr or so of their evolution. In fact, secondary clumps similar to the model predictions are observed in the CMD of nearby stars from Hipparcos data, and in those of some Large Magellanic Cloud fields observed to date. There are also several reasons why this secondary clump may be missing or hidden in other observed CMDs of galaxy fields. For instance, it becomes indistinguishable from the main clump if the photometric errors or differential absorption are larger than about 0.2mag. None the less, this structure may provide important constraints on the star formation history of Local Group galaxies. We comment also on the intrinsic luminosity variation and dispersion of clump stars, which may limit their use as either absolute or relative distance indicators, respectively.},

This feature has given rise to a series of methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge. Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature.},

We estimate the total bolometric energy of the flare was \$4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{33\}\$ erg, more powerful that the previously reported Kepler white light flares for the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648.47+401106.8, but weaker than the \$\textbackslash Delta V = -11\$ L0 dwarf superflare ASASSN-16ae. The initial (impulsive) cooling phase is too rapid to resolve with our 30-minute cadence data, but after one hour the gradual cooling phase has an exponential time constant of 1.8 hours. We use template fitting to estimate that the
full-time-width-at-half-amplitude of the light curve is \${$<$}10\$ minutes and that the true flare maximum reached \$\textbackslash sim70\$ times the stellar photosphere, or \$\textbackslash Delta V \textbackslash approx -8\$. This flare is comparable to the most powerful Kepler flares observed on the active M4 dwarf GJ 1243.},

  abstract = {Rotation is thought to drive cyclic magnetic activity in the Sun and Sun-like stars. Stellar dynamos, however, are poorly understood owing to the scarcity of observations of rotation and magnetic fields in stars. Here, inferences are drawn on the internal rotation of a distant Sun-like star by studying its global modes of oscillation. We report asteroseismic constraints imposed on the rotation rate and the inclination of the spin axis of the Sun-like star HD 52265, a principal target observed by the CoRoT satellite that is known to host a planetary companion. These seismic inferences are remarkably consistent with an independent spectroscopic observation (rotational line broadening) and with the observed rotation period of star spots. Furthermore, asteroseismology constrains the mass of exoplanet HD 52265b. Under the standard assumption that the stellar spin axis and the axis of the planetary orbit coincide, the minimum spectroscopic mass of the planet can be converted into a true mass of 1.85 (+0.52,-0.42) M\_Jupiter, which implies that it is a planet, not a brown dwarf.},

We report an asteroseismic measurement, with much better precision than interferometry, of the asphericity of an A-type star with a rotation period of 100 days. Using the fact that different modes of oscillation probe different stellar latitudes, we infer a tiny but significant flattening of the star's shape of \$\textbackslash Delta R/R = (1.8 \textbackslash pm 0.6) \textbackslash times 10\^\{-6\}\$. For a stellar radius \$R\$ that is \$2.24\$ times the solar radius, the difference in radius between the equator and the poles is \$\textbackslash Delta R = 3 \textbackslash pm 1\$ km. Because the observed \$\textbackslash Delta R/R\$ is only one-third of the expected rotational oblateness, we conjecture the presence of a weak magnetic field on a star that does not have an extended convective envelope.

The calculations take into account in a crude fashion the response of the convective flux to the oscillation. The dynamical effect of turbulence in the convection zone is parametrized in terms of a turbulent shear viscosity. The results show that if damping by turbulent viscosity is neglected, all modes with periods longer than 6 minutes are unstable. The familiar kappa-mechanism, which operates in the H ionization-H(-) opacity region, is the dominant source of driving of the oscillations. Modes with periods shorter than 6 minutes are stabilized by radiative damping in the solar atmosphere. When turbulent dissipation of pulsational energy is included, all modes are predicted to be stable. However, the margin of stability is very small. In view of the large uncertainty that must be assigned to the estimate of turbulent damping, it is concluded that theoretical calculations cannot unequivocally resolve the question of the stability of the solar p-modes.},

  abstract = {Based on the Gaia DR1 TGAS parallaxes and photometry from the Tycho-2, Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE catalogues, we have produced a sample of about 100 000 clump red giants within about 800 pc of the Sun. The systematic variations of the mode of their absolute magnitude as a function of the distance, magnitude, and other parameters have been analyzed. We show that these variations reach 0.7 mag and cannot be explained by variations in the interstellar extinction or intrinsic properties of stars and by selection. The only explanation seems to be a systematic error of the Gaia DR1 TGAS parallax dependent on the square of the observed distance in kpc: \$0.18R\^2\$ mas. Allowance for this error reduces significantly the systematic dependences of the absolute magnitude mode on all parameters. This error reaches 0.1 mas within 800 pc of the Sun and allows an upper limit for the accuracy of the TGAS parallaxes to be estimated as 0.2 mas. A careful allowance for such errors is needed to use clump red giants as "standard candles". This eliminates all discrepancies between the theoretical and empirical estimates of the characteristics of these stars and allows us to obtain the first estimates of the modes of their absolute magnitudes from the Gaia parallaxes: \$mode(M\_H)=-1.49\^m\textbackslash pm0.04\^m\$, \$mode(M\_\{K\_s\})=-1.63\^m\textbackslash pm0.03\^m\$, \$mode(M\_\{W1\})=-1.67\^m\textbackslash pm0.05\^m\$, \$mode(M\_\{W2\})=-1.67\^m\textbackslash pm0.05\^m\$, \$mode(M\_\{W3\})=-1.66\^m\textbackslash pm0.02\^m\$, \$mode(M\_\{W4\})=-1.73\^m\textbackslash pm0.03\^m\$, as well as the corresponding estimates of their de-reddened colors.},

Methods: A numerical model is developed that takes the various selection criteria and the properties of the Hipparcos catalogue into account. The biases involved in applying certain selections are estimated with this model. \\
Results: The absolute magnitudes that are found are M\textsubscript{I} = -0.22 {$\pm$} 0.03 and M\textsubscript{K} = -1.54 {$\pm$} 0.04 (on the 2MASS system). The I-band value is in good agreement with previous determinations, the K-band value is fainter than previously quoted, and this seems to be related to a selection bias whereby accurate K-magnitudes are only available for relatively few bright stars.

Here, we report the discovery of K2-132b, an inflated gas giant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another inflated planet, K2-97b. These planets orbit on {$\approx$}9 day orbits around host stars that recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation history of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet radii of 1.31 {$\pm$} 0.11 R \textsubscript{J} and 1.30 {$\pm$} 0.07 R \textsubscript{J}, respectively. These radii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the former, zero age main-sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current irradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and planets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency of both systems as 0.03\{ \% \}\textsubscript{-0.02 \% }\textsuperscript{+0.03 \% }. These results are consistent with a planet re-inflation scenario, but suggest that the efficiency of planet re-inflation may be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10\% of the stellar masses and radii, and the planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems, and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.},

  abstract = {The occurrence rate of hot Jupiters from the Kepler transit survey is 
roughly half that of radial velocity surveys targeting solar
neighborhood stars. One hypothesis to explain this difference is that
the two surveys target stars with different stellar metallicity
distributions. To test this hypothesis, we measure the metallicity
distribution of the Kepler targets using the Hectochelle multi-fiber,
high-resolution spectrograph. Limiting our spectroscopic analysis to 610
dwarf stars in our sample with log(g){$>$}3.5, we measure a metallicity
distribution characterized by a mean of [M/H]\_\{mean\} = -0.045 +/- 0.00,
in agreement with previous studies of the Kepler field target stars. In
comparison, the metallicity distribution of the California Planet Search
radial velocity sample has a mean of [M/H]\_\{CPS, mean\} = -0.005 +/-
0.006, and the samples come from different parent populations according
to a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We refit the exponential relation between
the fraction of stars hosting a close-in giant planet and the host star
metallicity using a sample of dwarf stars from the California Planet
Search with updated metallicities. The best-fit relation tells us that
the difference in metallicity between the two samples is insufficient to
explain the discrepant Hot Jupiter occurrence rates; the metallicity
difference would need to be \$\textbackslash simeq\$0.2-0.3 dex for perfect agreement.
We also show that (sub)giant contamination in the Kepler sample cannot
reconcile the two occurrence calculations. We conclude that other
factors, such as binary contamination and imperfect stellar properties,
must also be at play.},

We employ two complementary methods to fit TTVs: Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations based on N-body integration and an analytic fitting approach. Mass measurements of 49 planets, including 12 without previously reported masses, meet our criterion for classification as robust. Using mass and radius measurements, we infer the masses of planets' gaseous envelopes for both our TTV sample as well as transiting planets with radial velocity observations. Insight from analytic TTV formulae allows us to partially circumvent degeneracies inherent to inferring eccentricities from TTV observations. We find that planet eccentricities are generally small, typically a few percent, but in many instances are non-zero.},

Gaia DR2 has provided parallaxes for a billion stars, which are offset by a parallax zero-point. Red Clump (RC) stars have a narrow spread in luminosity, thus functioning as standard candles to calibrate these systematics. This work measures how the magnitude and spread of the RC in the Kepler field are affected by changes to temperature and scaling relations for seismology, and changes to the parallax zero-point for Gaia. We use a sample of 5576 RC stars classified through asteroseismology. We apply hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, finding the population level properties of the RC with seismology, and use those as priors on Gaia parallaxes to find the parallax zero-point offset. We then find the position of the RC using published values for the zero-point. We find a seismic temperature insensitive spread of the RC of \textasciitilde 0.03 mag in the 2MASS K band and a larger and slightly temperature-dependent spread of \textasciitilde 0.13 mag in the Gaia G band. This intrinsic dispersion in the K band provides a distance precision of \textasciitilde 1\% for RC stars. Using Gaia data alone, we find a mean zero-point of -41 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 10 \$\textbackslash mu\$as. This offset yields RC absolute magnitudes of -1.634 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.018 in K and 0.546 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.016 in G.

By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and line widths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the 'average' asteroseismic parameter {$\delta\nu$}\textsubscript{02}, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency and agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be 1.61 {$\pm$} 0.02 and 1.64 {$\pm$} 0.02 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, respectively. The difference {$\increment$}M = -0.03 {$\pm$} 0.01 M\textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

 Aims: The power spectra of solar-like oscillations are an inexhaustible source of information on stellar structure and evolution. Robust methods are hence needed in order to infer both individual oscillation mode parameters and parameters describing non-resonant features, thus making a seismic interpretation possible. \\
 Methods: We present a comprehensive guide to the implementation of a Bayesian peak-bagging tool that employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Besides making it possible to incorporate relevant prior information through Bayes' theorem, this tool also allows one to obtain the marginal probability density function for each of the fitted parameters. We apply this tool to a couple of recent asteroseismic data sets, namely, to CoRoT observations of HD 49933 and to ground-based observations made during a campaign devoted to Procyon. \\
 Results: The developed method performs remarkably well at constraining not only in the traditional case of extracting oscillation frequencies, but also when pushing the limit where traditional methods have difficulties. Moreover it provides an rigorous way of comparing competing models, such as the ridge identifications, against the asteroseismic data.},

cleaner photometric time series than the original data. The methods are
automated and can therefore easily be applied to a large number of
stars. The application of the filter is not restricted to planetary
hosts, but can be applied to any solar-like or red giant stars observed

Peg was confirmed to show short-period oscillations of the {$\beta$} Cep
type and simultaneous long-period pulsations typical of Slowly Pulsating
B (SPB) stars. From the measured amplitude ratios in the Str\"omgren
uvy passbands, the stronger of the two short period pulsation modes was
identified as radial; the second is l = 1. Three of the four SPB-type
modes are most likely l = 1 or 2. Comparison with theoretical model
calculations suggests that {$\gamma$} Peg is either a \textasciitilde 8.5
Msolar radial fundamental mode pulsator or a \textasciitilde 9.6
Msolar first radial overtone pulsator. HD 8801 was
corroborated as a `hybrid' {$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor star; four pulsation
modes of the {$\gamma$} Dor type were detected, and two modes of the
{$\delta$} Sct type were confirmed. Two pulsational signals between the
frequency domains of these two known classes of variables were confirmed
and another was newly detected. These are either previously unknown
types of pulsation or do not originate from HD 8801. The O-type star HD
13745 showed small-amplitude slow variability on a time-scale of 3.2 d.
This object may be related to the suspected new type of supergiant SPB
stars, but a rotational origin of its light variations cannot be ruled
out at this point. 53 Psc is an SPB star for which two pulsation
frequencies were determined and identified with low spherical degree.
Small-amplitude variability was formally detected for 53 Ari but is
suspected not to be intrinsic. The behaviour of {$\iota$} Her is consistent
with non-variability during our observations, and we could not confirm
light variations of the comparison star 34 Psc previously suspected. The
use of signal-to-noise criteria in the analysis of data sets with strong
aliasing is critically discussed.},

  abstract = {Distances to individual stars in our own Galaxy are critical in order to piece together the nature of its velocity and spatial structure. Core helium burning red clump (RC) stars have similar luminosities, are abundant throughout the Galaxy and thus constitute good standard candles. We build a hierarchical probabilistic model to quantify the quality of RC stars as standard candles using parallax measurements from the first Gaia data release. A unique aspect of our methodology is to fully account for (and marginalize over) parallax, photometry and dust correction uncertainties, which lead to more robust results than standard approaches. We determine the absolute magnitude and intrinsic dispersion of the RC in 2MASS bands J, H, K\textsubscript{s}, Gaia G band and WISE bands W1, W2, W3 and W4. We find that the absolute magnitude of the RC is -1.61 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in K\textsubscript{s}), +0.44 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in G), -0.93 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in J), -1.46 {$\pm$} 0.01 (in H), -1.68 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W1), -1.69 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W2), -1.67 {$\pm$} 0.02 (in W3) and -1.76 {$\pm$} 0.01 mag (in W4). The mean intrinsic dispersion is{\~ }0.17 {$\pm$} 0.03 mag across all bands (yielding a typical distance precision of{\~ }8 per cent). Thus RC stars are reliable and precise standard candles. In addition, we have also re-calibrated the zero-point of the absolute magnitude of the RC in each band, which provides a benchmark for future studies to estimate distances to RC stars. Finally, the parallax error shrinkage in the hierarchical model outlined in this work can be used to obtain more precise parallaxes than Gaia for the most distant RC stars across the Galaxy.},

In this paper, we use a sample of 1676 RGB and RC stars that have both single epoch infrared spectra from the APOGEE survey and asteroseismic parameters and classification to show that the spectra alone can be used to (1) predict asteroseismic parameters with precision high enough to (2) distinguish core helium burning RC from other giant stars with less than 2\% contamination. This will not only allow for a clean selection of a large number of standard candles across our own and other galaxies from spectroscopic surveys, but also will remove one of the primary roadblocks for stellar evolution studies of mixing and mass loss in red giant stars.},

  abstract = {Records of observations of sunspots and auroras in pre-telescopic historical documents provide useful information about past solar activity both in long-term trends and short-term space weather events. In this study, we present the results of a comprehensive survey of the records of sunspots and aurora candidates in the Yu\textbackslash 'ansh\textbackslash v\{i\} and M\textbackslash 'ingsh\textbackslash v\{i\}, Chinese Official Histories spanning 1261-1368 and 1368-1644, based on continuous observations with well-formatted reportds conducted by contemporary professional astronomers. We then provide a brief comparison of these data with Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as an indicator of the solar activity during the corresponding periods to show significant active phases between 1350s-80s and 1610s-30s. We then compared the former with contemporary Russian reports for naked-eye sunspots and the latter with contemporary sunspot drawings based on Western telescopic observations. Especially some of the latter are consistent with nitrate signals preserved in ice cores. These results show us some insights on not only minima and maxima of solar activity during 13th - 17th century.},

Long near-interrupted high-precision photometric timeseries observations from dedicated space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler have provided seismic inferences of the global and internal properties of a large number of evolved stars, including red giants. These inferences are confronted with predictions from theoretical models to improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Our knowledge and understanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in the data. Unraveling this will further improve our understanding of stellar evolution. This will also have significant impact on our knowledge of the Milky Way Galaxy as well as on exo-planet host stars. The latter is important for our understanding of the formation and structure of planetary systems.},

As the solar system is teeming with moons, more than a hundred of which are in orbit around the eight local planets, and with all of the local giant planets showing complex ring systems, astronomers have naturally started to search for moons and rings around exoplanets in the past few years. We here discuss the principles of the observational methods that have been proposed to find moons and rings beyond the solar system and we review the first searches.

This is the highest mass measured for any pulsating white dwarf with known rotation, suggesting a possible link between high mass and fast rotation. If it is the product of single-star evolution, its progenitor was a roughly 4.0 solar-mass main-sequence B star; we know very little about the angular momentum evolution of such intermediate-mass stars. We explore the possibility that this rapidly rotating white dwarf is the byproduct of a binary merger, which we conclude is unlikely given the pulsation periods observed.},

of stellar attributes ("labels," i.e. parameters and abundances) must be
made precise and consistent across surveys. Here, we demonstrate that
this can be achieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling.
With The Cannon, we transfer information from the APOGEE survey to
determine precise Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M] from the spectra
of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon fits a predictive model for LAMOST
spectra using 9952 stars observed in common between the two surveys,
taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth: Teff, log g,
[Fe/H], [\textbackslash alpha/M], and K-band extinction \$A\_k\$. The model is then used
to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20\%
of the LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M]
values for the full set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of
[\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M] for giant stars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by
construction on the APOGEE label scale; for spectra with S/N {$>$} 50,
cross-validation of the model yields typical uncertainties of 70K in
Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in [\$\textbackslash alpha\$/M], values
comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12
uncertainties. Thus, by using "label transfer" to tie low-resolution
(LAMOST R \$\textbackslash sim\$ 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much
higher-resolution (APOGEE R \$\textbackslash sim\$ 22,500) survey, we substantially
reduce the inconsistencies between labels measured by the individual
survey pipelines. This demonstrates that label transfer with The Cannon
can successfully bring different surveys onto the same physical scale.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

Unfortunately, we aren't (at present) given access to the Gaia data directly; we are only given a Catalog of derived astrometric properties for the stars. How do we perform probabilistic inferences in this context? The answer - implicit in many publications - is that we should look at the Gaia Catalog as containing the parameters of a likelihood function, or a probability of the Gaia data, conditioned on stellar properties, evaluated at the location of the data. Concretely, my recommendation is to assume (for, say, the parallax) that the Catalog-reported value and uncertainty are the mean and root-variance of a Gaussian function that can stand in for the true likelihood function. This is the implicit assumption in most Gaia literature to date; my only goal here is to make the assumption explicit. Certain technical choices by the Mission team slightly invalidate this assumption for DR1 (TGAS), but not seriously. Generalizing beyond Gaia, it is important to downstream users of any Catalog products that they deliver likelihood information about the fundamental data; this is a challenge for the probabilistic catalogs of the future.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed solar-like oscillations in \textasciitilde 1700 stars observed by the Kepler Mission, spanning from the main sequence to the red clump. Using evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}\textsubscript{max}), the large frequency separation ({$\increment\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the difference of the {$\increment\nu$}-{$\nu$}\textsubscript{max} relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M)\textsuperscript{ s } scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \&amp; Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of \textasciitilde 25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

We identify slow variations in the MOST data that are similar to those reported in the RV time series and confirm by comparison with the Sun that these variations are likely the signature of stellar activity. The MOST power spectrum yields clear evidence for individual oscillation frequencies that match those found in the RV data by Bedding et al. We identify the same ridges due to modes of different spherical degree in both data sets, but are not able to confirm a definite ridge identification using the MOST data. We measure the luminosity amplitude per radial mode A \textsubscript{ l=0,phot} = 9.1 {$\pm$} 0.5 ppm. Combined with the estimate for the RV data by Arentoft et al., this gives a mean amplitude ratio of A \textsubscript{ l=0,phot}/A \textsubscript{ l=0,RV} = 0.24 {$\pm$} 0.02 ppm cm\textsuperscript{-1} s, considerably higher than expected from scaling relations but in reasonable agreement with theoretical models by Houdek. We also compare the amplitude ratio as a function of frequency and find that the maximum of the oscillation envelope is shifted to higher frequencies in photometry than in velocity.

We used asteroseismology to measure a large obliquity for Kepler-56, a red giant star hosting two transiting coplanar planets. These observations show that spin-orbit misalignments are not confined to hot-Jupiter systems. Misalignments in a broader class of systems had been predicted as a consequence of torques from wide-orbiting companions, and indeed radial velocity measurements revealed a third companion in a wide orbit in the Kepler-56 system.},

The catalog is based on a compilation of literature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry, spectroscopy, asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were then homogeneously fitted to a grid of Dartmouth stellar isochrones. We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report the detection of oscillations in 2762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by \textasciitilde 20\% to a total of \textasciitilde 15,500 stars. Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are \textasciitilde 40\% and \textasciitilde 20\%, respectively, for stars with photometric constraints only, and 5\%-15\% and \textasciitilde 10\% for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison with the Q1-Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii of M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs decrease or increase depending on the Q1-Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei-Yale isochrones). Radii of F-G dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identified giants. The Q1-Q16 star properties catalog is a first step toward an improved characterization of all Kepler targets to support planet-occurrence studies.},

Residual systematic differences are at the {$\approx$}2\% level in parallax across three orders of magnitude.

We find no significant offset for main-sequence ({$\lessequivlnt$} 1.5 \{R\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }) and low-luminosity RGB stars ({$\approx$}3-8 \{R\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }), but seismic radii appear to be systematically underestimated by {$\approx$}5\% for subgiants ({$\approx$}1.5-3 \{R\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }).

  abstract = {Eclipsing binaries have long served as benchmark systems to measure fundamental properties of stars. In recent decades, asteroseismology\textemdash the study of stellar pulsations\textemdash has emerged as a powerful new tool to study the structure and evolution of stars across the H-R diagram. Pulsating stars in eclipsing binary systems are particularly valuable since fundamental properties such as radii and masses can then be determined using two independent techniques. Furthermore, independently measured properties from binary orbits can be used to improve asteroseismic modelling for pulsating stars in which mode identifications are not straightforward. This chapter provides a review of asteroseismic detections in eclipsing binary stars, with a focus on space-based missions such as CoRoT and Kepler and empirical tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for stochastic (`solar-like') oscillations.},

  abstract = {A strong longitudinal magnetic field of the order of 5.2kG was recently detected in CPD-62 2124 in the framework of the BOB collaboration. Our spectropolarimetric monitoring of this star with FORS2 at the VLT revealed the presence of a huge magnetic field dominated by a dipolar component with a polar strength between 32.5 and 35.7kG. Such an extraordinary strong magnetic field strength was not previously detected in any massive early-B type star. Although being in an advanced evolutionary state, CPD-62 2124 rotates fast with v\_eq {$>$}= 176 km/s over the period P\_rot = 1.45031+-0.00002d. An analysis of the spectral variability of CPD-62 2124 on different time scales shows, apart from the rotational modulation of the line profiles, also distinct changes in shape and position of line profiles taking place on time-scales corresponding to the duration of the sub-exposure sequences. This short-term variability can probably be attributed to betaCep like pulsations. The rotational variability pattern of hydrogen and metal lines exhibits a similar behaviour while the He lines vary opposite to all other elements studied, indicating a different elemental surface distribution.},

rotation, then only a portion of it can rotate at the orbital period, so
the rotation period at the surface may not match the orbital period. The
difference between the rotation and orbital periods can therefore be
used to infer the extent of the differential rotation. We use a simple
parametrization of differential rotation in stars with convective
envelopes in circular orbits to predict the difference between the
surface rotation period and the orbital period. Comparing this
parametrization to observed eclipsing binary systems, we find that in
the surface convection zones of stars in short-period binaries there is
very little radial differential rotation, with |r{$\partial$}rln
{$\Omega$}| {$<$} 0.02. This holds even for longer orbital periods, though
it is harder to say which systems are synchronized at long periods, and
larger differential rotation is degenerate with asynchronous rotation.},

The pseudomodes are shifted slightly in frequency with respect to p modes making possible the use of pseudomodes to determine the acoustic cut-off frequency. Using data from GOLF and VIRGO instruments on board the SOHO spacecraft, we calculate the acoustic cut-off frequency using the coherence function between both the velocity and intensity sets of data.

  abstract = {Aims: We present fundamental stellar parameters, chemical 
abundances, and rotational velocities for a sample of 86 evolved stars
with planets (56 giants; 30 subgiants), and for a control sample of 137
stars (101 giants; 36 subgiants) without planets. The analysis was based
on both high signal-to-noise and resolution echelle spectra. The main
goals of this work are i) to investigate chemical differences between
evolved stars that host planets and those of the control sample without
planets; ii) to explore potential differences between the properties of
the planets around giants and subgiants; and iii) to search for possible
correlations between these properties and the chemical abundances of
their host stars. Implications for the scenarios of planet formation and
evolution are also discussed. Methods: The fundamental stellar
parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], {$\xi$}t) were
computed homogeneously using the FUNDPAR code. The chemical abundances
of 14 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, and
Ba) were obtained using the MOOG code. Rotational velocities were
derived from the full width at half maximum of iron isolated lines. Results: In agreement with previous studies, we find that subgiants
with planets are, on average, more metal-rich than subgiants without
planets by \textasciitilde 0.16 dex. The [Fe/H] distribution of giants with planets is
centered at slightly subsolar metallicities and there is no metallicity
enhancement relative to the [Fe/H] distribution of giants without
planets. Furthermore, contrary to recent results, we do not find any
clear difference between the metallicity distributions of stars with and
without planets for giants with M{$\star>$} 1.5
M{$\odot$}. With regard to the other chemical elements, the
analysis of the [X/Fe] distributions shows differences between giants
with and without planets for some elements, particularly V, Co, and Ba.
Subgiants with and without planets exhibit similar behavior for most of
the elements. On the other hand, we find no evidence of rapid rotation
among the giants with planets or among the giants without planets.
Finally, analyzing the planet properties, some interesting trends might
be emerging: i) multi-planet systems around evolved stars show a slight
metallicity enhancement compared with single-planet systems; ii) planets
with a {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.5 AU orbit subgiants with [Fe/H] {$>$} 0 and giants
hosting planets with a {$\lessequivlnt$} 1 AU have [Fe/H] {$<$} 0; iii) higher-mass
planets tend to orbit more metal-poor giants with M{$\star$}
{$\leq$} 1.5 M{$\odot$}, whereas planets around subgiants seem to
follow the planet-mass metallicity trend observed on dwarf hosts; iv)
[X/Fe] ratios for Na, Si, and Al seem to increase with the mass of
planets around giants; v) planets orbiting giants show lower orbital
eccentricities than those orbiting subgiants and dwarfs, suggesting a
more efficient tidal circularization or the result of the engulfment of
close-in planets with larger eccentricities.

Stars are a useful way to study this history, because properties such as their composition, age, and orbital motion can map galaxy formation and evolution. Lightcurves from the Kepler mission, both original and extended, provide asteroseismic parameters, such as {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} and {$\nu\_$}max, and rotation periods. The high-resolution near-infrared APOGEE spectroscopic survey is observing an extensive sample of red giants and cool dwarfs in both the Kepler and K2 fields to provide composition and effective temperature measurements. These spectroscopic and seismic parameters can be combined to yield ages, important for dissecting the history of the Milky Way. Results based on this
combination have already been published in the first APOKASC catalog. Among the interesting results about stellar populations so far are the presence of a large metallicity spread in the young secondary red clump population at the solar circle, the identification of young, yet {$\alpha$}-rich stars, and the detection of a field blue straggler
descendant. The K2 fields along the ecliptic will extend the
possibilities of these techniques to new lines of sight in the Galaxy and provide a much more representative sample of Galactic populations with seismic and spectroscopic information.},

  abstract = {Context. It was recently discovered that the period spacings of mixed pressure/gravity dipole modes in red giants permit a distinction between the otherwise unknown evolutionary stage of these stars. The Kepler space mission is reaching continuous observing times long enough to also start studying the fine structure of the observed pressure-mode spectra. \\
 Aims: In this paper, we aim to study the signature of stellar evolution on the radial and pressure-dominated l = 2 modes in an ensemble of red giants that show solar-type oscillations. \\
 Methods: We use established methods to automatically identify the mode degree of l = 0 and 2 modes and measure the large ({$\increment\nu$}\textsubscript{c}) and small ({$\delta\nu$}\textsubscript{02}) frequency separation around the central radial mode. We then determine the phase shift {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c} of the central radial mode, i.e. the linear offset in the asymptotic fit to the acoustic modes. Furthermore we measure the individual frequencies of radial modes and investigate their average curvature. \\
 Results: We find that {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c} is significantly different for red giants at a given {$\increment\nu$}\textsubscript{c} but which burn only H in a shell (RGB) than those that have already ignited core He burning. Even though not directly probing the stellar core the pair of local seismic observables ({$\increment\nu$}\textsubscript{c}, {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c}) can be used as an evolutionary stage discriminator that turned out to be as reliable as the period spacing of the mixed dipole modes. We find a tight correlation between {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c} and {$\increment\nu$}\textsubscript{c} for RGB stars and unlike less evolved stars we find no indication that {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c} depends on other properties of the star. It appears that the difference in {$\smallin$}\textsubscript{c} between the two populations becomes smaller and eventually indistinguishable if we use an average of several radial orders, instead of a local, i.e. only around the central radial mode, large separation to determine the phase shift. This indicates that the information on the evolutionary stage is encoded locally, more precisely in the shape of the radial mode sequence. This shape turns out to be approximately symmetric around the central radial mode for RGB stars but asymmetric for core He burning stars. We computed radial mode frequencies for a sequence of red-giant models and find them to qualitatively confirm our findings. We also find that, at least in our models, the local {$\increment\nu$} is an at least as good and mostly better proxy for both the asymptotic spacing and the large separation scaled from the model density than the average {$\increment\nu$}. Finally, we investigate the signature of the evolutionary stage on {$\delta\nu$}\textsubscript{02} and quantify the mass dependency of this seismic parameter.},

It has been shown that its characteristic timescale and rms intensity fluctuation scale with the peak frequency (\textbackslash nu\_\{max\}) of the solar-like oscillations. Various attempts have been made to quantify the observed signal, to determine scaling relations, and to compare them to theoretical predictions. We use a probabilistic method to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them. We establish that a depression in power at about \textbackslash nu\_\{max\}/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of \textbackslash nu\_\{max\}, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic background frequency and amplitude to tightly scale with \textbackslash nu\_\{max\} for a wide variety of stars, and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions, we computed effective timescales and intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as \textbackslash tau\_\{eff\} \textbackslash propto g\^\{-0.85\}\textbackslash,T\^\{-0.4\} and A\_\{gran\} \textbackslash propto (g\^2M)\^\{-1/4\}, respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as A\_\{puls\} \textbackslash propto (g\^2M)\^\{-1/3\}, which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of A\_\{puls\}.},

This enables to evaluate the spin-orbit angle of transiting planetary systems in a complementary fashion to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, a well-established method to estimate the projected spin-orbit angle {$\lambda$}. Although the asteroseismic method has been broadly applied to the Kepler data, its reliability is yet to be assessed intensively. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of i\textsubscript{{$\star$}} from asteroseismology of solar-like stars using 3000 simulated power spectra. We find that the low-signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectra induces a systematic underestimate (overestimate) bias for stars with high (low) inclinations. We derive analytical criteria for the reliable asteroseismic estimate, which indicates that reliable measurements are possible in the range of 20\textdegree{} {$\lessequivlnt$} i\textsubscript{{$\star$}} {$\lessequivlnt$} 80\textdegree{} only for stars with high-signal-to-noise ratio. We also analyse and measure the stellar inclination of 94 Kepler main-sequence solar-like stars, among that 33 are planetary hosts. According to our reliability criteria, a third of them (nine with planets, 22 without) have accurate stellar inclination. Comparison of our asteroseismic estimate of vsin i\textsubscript{{$\star$}} against spectroscopic measurements indicates that the latter suffers from a large uncertainty possibly due to the modelling of macroturbulence, especially for stars with projected rotation speed vsin i\textsubscript{{$\star$}} {$\lessequivlnt$} 5 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. This reinforces earlier claims, and the stellar inclination estimated from the combination of measurements from spectroscopy and photometric variation for slowly rotating stars needs to be interpreted with caution.},

  abstract = {Observations of Sun-like stars over the last half-century have improved our understanding of how magnetic dynamos, like that responsible for the 11-year solar cycle, change with rotation, mass and age. Here we show for the first time how metallicity can affect a stellar dynamo. Using the most complete set of observations of a stellar cycle ever obtained for a Sun-like star, we show how the solar analog HD 173701 exhibits solar-like differential rotation and a 7.4-year activity cycle. While the duration of the cycle is comparable to that generated by the solar dynamo, the amplitude of the brightness variability is substantially stronger. The only significant difference between HD 173701 and the Sun is its metallicity, which is twice the solar value. Therefore, this provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability. The observations can be explained by the higher metallicity of the star, which is predicted to foster a deeper outer convection zone and a higher facular contrast, resulting in stronger variability.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: \textbullet From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory.\textbullet Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis.\textbullet Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis.\textbullet Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested.\textbullet Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods.\textbullet In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests.\textbullet The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions.\textbullet When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty.\textbullet Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large.\textbullet Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process.\textbullet It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

Data from global observing campaigns have revealed a wealth of frequencies, some of which show the signature of rotational splitting. Tools developed for helioseismology to use many solar p-mode frequencies for inversion of the rotation rate with depth are adapted to the case of more limited numbers of modes of low degree. We find that the small number of available modes in white dwarfs, coupled with the similarity between the rotational-splitting kernels of the modes, renders direct inversion unstable. Accordingly, we adopt what we consider to be plausible functional forms for the differential rotation profile; this is sufficiently restrictive to enable us to carry out a useful calibration. We show examples of this technique for PG 1159 stars and pulsating DB white dwarfs. Published frequency splittings for white dwarfs are currently not accurate enough for meaningful inversions; reanalysis of existing data can provide splittings of sufficient accuracy when the frequencies of individual peaks are extracted via least-squares fitting or multipeak decompositions. We find that, when mode trapping is evident in the period spacing of g modes, the measured splittings can constrain d{$\Omega$}/dr.},

  abstract = {A general expression for angular momentum loss by magnetic stellar winds is applied to evolutionary stellar models to see if such wind models can account for the total loss of angular momentum in low-mass stars. Reasonable wind models do indeed extract sufficient angular momentum for two limiting cases of the internal angular momentum distribution. Most of the angular momentum is lost in the vicinity of the zero-age main sequence. These computations allows testing of models of angular momentum loss by comparison with a variety of observations. The existence of very rapidly rotating stars in young clusters implies that low-mass stars are formed with a large spread in angular momentum. The high efficiency of angular momentum loss through magnetic stellar winds causes the rotation velocity to become less dependent on initial angular momentum (J0) with time; by 3 x 108 yr, the rotation velocity becomes independent of J0. This results in a decrease with time in the spread of rotation velocities as a function of stellar mass in young clusters. Data on the rotation of G and K stars in young clusters suggests that initially only the outer convective envelope in low-mass stars is spun down, as suggested by Stauffer and Hartmann. But by 100 million yr, essentially the entire stellar interior has spun down.},

By combining asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints, we expand the analysis of the bump to masses and metallicities beyond those previously accessible using globular clusters. Our data set comprises nearly 3000 red-giant stars observed by Kepler and with APOGEE spectra. Using statistical mixture models, we are able to detect the bump in the average seismic parameters {$\nu$} \textsubscript{max} and \&lt; \{\{{$\increment$} \}\}{$\nu$} \&gt; , and show that its observed position reveals general trends with mass and metallicity in line with expectations from models. Moreover, our analysis indicates that standard stellar models underestimate the depth of efficiently mixed envelopes. The inclusion of significant overshooting from the base of the convective envelope, with an efficiency that increases with decreasing metallicity, allows us to reproduce the observed location of the bump. Interestingly, this trend was also reported in previous studies of globular clusters.},

Despite a very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about 500 and 700 red giants (all either in the RGB or RC phase) selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging in a thorough comparison of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point, in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third data release of Gaia.},

  abstract = {Context. The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The oscillations of the Sun are known to vary with its activity cycle and these changes provide diagnostics on the conditions below the photosphere. Kepler has detected oscillations in hundreds of solar-like stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of signatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these stars have been reported. Aims. We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of 24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the aim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation parameters. Methods. We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by measuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope, as well as granulation time scales. Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency shifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of them. We find that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and rotation period. For the most prominent example, KIC 8006161, we find that, similar to the solar case, frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and largest for the highest p-mode frequencies. Conclusions. These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely observed in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the possibility to place the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by asteroseismology.},

Localizing subsurface magnetic field concentrations in the Sun with helioseismology will help us to understand the solar dynamo. Because the magnetic fields are not considered in standard solar models, adding them to the basic equations of stellar structure changes the eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies. We use quasi-degenerate
perturbation theory to calculate the effect of toroidal magnetic fields on solar oscillation mean multiplet frequencies for six field
configurations. In our calculations, we consider both the direct effect of the magnetic field, which describes the coupling of modes, and the indirect effect, which accounts for changes in stellar structure due to the magnetic field. We limit our calculations to self-coupling of modes. We find that the magnetic field affects the multiplet frequencies in a way that depends on the location and the geometry of the field inside the Sun. Comparing our theoretical results with observed shifts, we find that strong tachocline fields cannot be responsible for the observed frequency shifts of p modes over the solar cycle. We also find that part of the surface effect in helioseismic oscillation frequencies might be attributed to magnetic fields in the outer layers of the Sun. The theory presented here is also applicable to models of solar-like stars and their oscillation frequencies.},

  abstract = {There are no good predictions for the amplitudes expected from solar-like oscillations in other stars. In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations {$\delta$}L/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy ({$\delta$}L/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,\textsubscript{sun}\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be {$\delta$}L/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \&amp; Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., {$\alpha$} Cen A and {$\beta$} Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission, launched on 2009 March 6, was designed with the explicit capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars using the transit photometry method. Results from just 43 days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique, precise, extended, and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes, and eventually the results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars from red giants.},

  abstract = {Magnetic fields are essential ingredients of many physical processes in the interiors and envelopes of cool stars. Yet their direct detection and characterisation is notoriously difficult, requiring high-quality observations and advanced analysis techniques. Significant progress has been recently achieved by several types of direct magnetic field studies on the surfaces of cool active stars. In particular, complementary techniques of the field topology mapping with polarisation data and total magnetic flux measurements from intensity spectra have been systematically applied to different classes of active stars leading to interesting and occasionally controversial results. In this paper we summarise the current status of direct magnetic field studies of cool stars, and investigations of surface inhomogeneities caused by the field, based on the material presented at the Cool Stars 19 splinter session.},

  abstract = {The rotational velocities of a large sample of field stars with spectral types between F2 IV, V and G3 IV, V have been obtained from coude' spectrograms of resolution about 6 km/sec. It is shown that the average rotational velocity is higher among those with Ca ii emission than among those without. Since there is strong evidence that stars with Ca ii emission are younger, on the average, than most solar-type stars, a picture is advanced in which rotation declines with advancing age. It is proposed that magnetically coupled winds, similar to the solar wind, are responsible for this deceleration even after a star takes up residence on the main sequence. The winds are presumably generated only in stars which have subsurface hydrogen convection zones and concomitant chromospheres. Estimates of rotational velocity among solar-type stars in the Hyades and Pleiades are given which confirm this general picture. It is shown that the mean rotation in the Pleiades is highest of all groups considered and averages about 40 km/sec for stars of mass 1.20 o. The time scale for reduction by a factor of 2 of the rotational velocities of Pleiades stars is equal to the age of the Hyades, about 4 X 108 years.},

For our main DR5 catalog, stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and overall metallicity) are computed using the RAVE DR4 stellar pipeline, but calibrated using recent K2 Campaign 1 seismic gravities and Gaia benchmark stars, as well as results obtained from high-resolution studies. Also included are temperatures from the Infrared Flux Method, and we provide a catalog of red giant stars in the dereddened color \{(J-\{Ks\})\}0 interval (0.50, 0.85) for which the gravities were calibrated based only on seismology. Further data products for subsamples of the RAVE stars include individual abundances for Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ni, and distances found using isochrones. Each RAVE spectrum is complemented by an error spectrum, which has been used to determine uncertainties on the parameters. The data can be accessed via the RAVE Web site or the VizieR database.},

BY Dra candidates are pre-selected from their position in the HR diagram, built from Gaia parallaxes, \$G\$ magnitudes, and \$(G\_\{BP\} - G\_\{RP\})\$ colours. Since the time evolution of the stellar active region can disrupt the coherence of the signal, segments not much longer than their expected evolution timescale are extracted from the entire photometric time-series and period search algorithms are applied to each segment. For the Gaia DR2, we select sources having similar period in at least two segments as candidates BY Dra. Results are further filtered considering the time series phase coverage and the expected approximate light curve shape. Gaia DR2 includes rotational periods and modulation amplitudes of 147 535 BY Dra candidates. The data unveil the existence of two populations with distinctive period and amplitude distributions. The sample covers 38\% of the whole sky when divided in bins (HEALPix) of \$\textbackslash approx\$0.84 square degrees and we estimate that represents 0.7 -- 5 \% of all BY Dra stars potentially detectable by Gaia. The preliminary data contained in Gaia DR2 illustrate the vast and unique information that the mission is going to provide on stellar rotation and magnetic activity. This information, complemented by Gaia exquisite parallaxes, proper motions, and astrophysical parameter, is opening new and unique perspectives for our understanding of the evolution of stellar angular momentum and dynamo action.},

Using K2 Campaign 5 and 16 light curves and the spectral archive of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we identify 11 3D kinematic members of M67 with anomalously fast rotation periods of 2-8 days, implying ages of less than 1 Gyr. We hypothesize that these anomalously fast rotators have been spun up by mass transfer, mergers, or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters within the 1 Gyr and thus represent lower-luminosity counterparts to the blue straggler stars. These 11 candidate post-interaction stellar systems have much in common with the blue stragglers, including a high binary fraction (73\%); a number of long-period, low-eccentricity binary systems; and in at least one case a UV excess consistent with the presence of a hot white dwarf companion. The identification of these 11 systems provides the first picture of the low-luminosity end of the blue straggler distribution, providing new constraints for detailed binary evolution models and cluster population studies. This result also clearly demonstrates the need to properly account for the impact of binaries on stellar evolution, as significant numbers of post-interaction binaries likely exist on cluster main sequences and in the field. These stars are not always easy to identify but make up{\~ }10\% or more of the spectroscopic binary population among the solar-type stars in M67.},

  abstract = {The cosmological exploitation of modern photometric galaxy surveys requires both accurate (unbiased) and precise (narrow) redshift probability distributions derived from broadband photometry. Existing methodologies do not meet those requirements. Standard template fitting delivers interpretable models and errors, but lacks flexibility to learn inaccuracies in the observed photometry or the spectral templates. Machine learning addresses those issues, but requires representative training data, and the resulting models and uncertainties cannot be interpreted in the context of a physical model or outside of the training data. We present a hierarchical modeling approach simultaneously addressing the issues of flexibility, interpretability, and generalization. It combines template fitting with flexible (machine learning-like) models to correct the spectral templates, model their redshift distributions, and recalibrate the photometric observations. By optimizing the full posterior distribution of the model and solving for its (thousands of) parameters, one can perform a global statistical calibration of the data and the SED model. We apply this approach to the public Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data, and show that it provides more accurate and compact redshift posterior distributions than existing methods, as well as insights into residual photometric and SED systematics. The model is causal, makes predictions for future data (e.g., additional photometric bandpasses), and its internal parameters and components are interpretable. This approach does not formally require the training data to be complete or representative; in principle it can even work in regimes in which few or no spectroscopic redshifts are available.},

This is achieved with a data-driven model of the color-magnitude diagram, not relying on stellar models but instead on the relative abundances of stars in color-magnitude cells, which are inferred from very noisy magnitudes and parallaxes. While the resulting noise-deconvolved color-magnitude diagram can be useful for a range of applications, we focus on deriving improved stellar distance estimates relying on both parallax and photometric information. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach on the 1.4 million stars of the Gaia TGAS sample that also have AAVSO Photometric All Sky Survey magnitudes. Our hierarchical model has 4 million parameters in total, most of which are marginalized out numerically or analytically. We find that distance estimates are significantly improved for the noisiest parallaxes and densest regions of the color-magnitude diagram. In particular, the average distance signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and uncertainty improve by 19\% and 36\%, respectively, with 8\% of the objects improving in S/N by a factor greater than 2. This computationally efficient approach fully accounts for both parallax and photometric noise and is a first step toward a full hierarchical probabilistic model of the Gaia data.},

The astrometric core solution will determine the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for a subset of these sources, using a global solution approach which must also include a large number of parameters for the satellite attitude and optical instrument. The accurate and efficient implementation of this solution is an extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of the mission. \\
 Aims: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and physical models applicable to this solution, as well as its numerical and algorithmic framework. \\
 Methods: The astrometric core solution is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of about half a billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters for some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The global nature of the solution requires an iterative approach, which can be broken down into a small number of distinct processing blocks (source, attitude, calibration and global updating) and auxiliary processes (including the frame rotator and selection of primary sources). We describe each of these processes in some detail, formulate the underlying models, from which the observation equations are derived, and outline the adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of robustness and the structure of the resulting system of equations. Appendices provide brief introductions to some important mathematical tools (quaternions and B-splines for the attitude representation, and a modified Cholesky algorithm for positive semidefinite problems) and discuss some complications expected in the real mission data. \\
 Results: A complete software system called AGIS (Astrometric Global Iterative Solution) is being built according to the methods described in the paper. Based on simulated data for 2 million primary sources we present some initial results, demonstrating the basic mathematical and numerical validity of the approach and, by a reasonable extrapolation, its practical feasibility in terms of data management and computations for the real mission.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) contains astrometric results for more than 1 billion stars brighter than magnitude 20.7 based on observations collected by the Gaia satellite during the first 14 months of its operational phase. \\
 Aims: We give a brief overview of the astrometric content of the data release and of the model assumptions, data processing, and validation of the results. \\
 Methods: For stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues, complete astrometric single-star solutions are obtained by incorporating positional information from the earlier catalogues. For other stars only their positions are obtained, essentially by neglecting their proper motions and parallaxes. The results are validated by an analysis of the residuals, through special validation runs, and by comparison with external data. \\
 Results: For about two million of the brighter stars (down to magnitude 11.5) we obtain positions, parallaxes, and proper motions to Hipparcos-type precision or better. For these stars, systematic errors depending for example on position and colour are at a level of {$\pm$} 0.3 milliarcsecond (mas). For the remaining stars we obtain positions at epoch J2015.0 accurate to 10 mas. Positions and proper motions are given in a reference frame that is aligned with the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) to better than 0.1 mas at epoch J2015.0, and non-rotating with respect to ICRF to within 0.03 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. The Hipparcos reference frame is found to rotate with respect to the Gaia DR1 frame at a rate of 0.24 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. \\
 Conclusions: Based on less than a quarter of the nominal mission length and on very provisional and incomplete calibrations, the quality and completeness of the astrometric data in Gaia DR1 are far from what is expected for the final mission products. The present results nevertheless represent a huge improvement in the available fundamental stellar data and practical definition of the optical reference frame.},

  abstract = {Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) contains results for 1693 million sources in the magnitude range 3 to 21 based on observations collected by the European Space Agency Gaia satellite during the first 22 months of its operational phase. We describe the input data, models, and processing used for the astrometric content of Gaia DR2, and the validation of these results performed within the astrometry task. Some 320 billion centroid positions from the pre-processed astrometric CCD observations were used to estimate the five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) for 1332 million sources, and approximate positions at the reference epoch J2015.5 for an additional 361 million mostly faint sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G\&lt;14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G=17 mag, and 0.7 mas at G=20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas/yr, respectively. The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas/yr. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas/yr in proper motion are seen on small (\&lt;1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales. Important statistics and information for the users of the Gaia DR2 astrometry are given in the appendices.},

  abstract = {Context. It is well known that the magnetic activity of solar-type stars decreases with age, but it is widely debated in the literature whether there is a smooth decline or if there is an early sharp drop until 1-2 Gyr that is followed by a relatively inactive constant phase. \\
 Aims: We revisited the activity-age relation using time-series observations of a large sample of solar twins whose precise isochronal ages and other important physical parameters have been determined. \\
 Methods: We measured the Ca II H and K activity indices using {$\approx$}9000 HARPS spectra of 82 solar twins. In addition, the average solar activity was calculated through asteroids and Moon reflection spectra using the same instrumentation. Thus, we transformed our activity indices into the S Mount Wilson scale (S\textsubscript{MW}), recalibrated the Mount Wilson absolute flux and photospheric correction equations as a function of T\textsubscript{eff}, and then computed an improved bolometric flux normalized activity index log R'\textsubscript{HK} (T\textsubscript{eff}) for the entire sample. \\
 Results: New relations between activity and the age of solar twins were derived by assessing the chromospheric age-dating limits using log R'\textsubscript{HK} (T\textsubscript{eff}). We measured an average solar activity of S\textsubscript{MW} = 0.1712 {$\pm$} 0.0017 during solar magnetic cycles 23-24 covered by HARPS observations, and we also inferred an average of S\textsubscript{MW} = 0.1694 {$\pm$} 0.0025 for cycles 10-24, anchored on a sunspot number correlation of S index versus. We also found a simple relation between the average and the dispersion of the activity levels of solar twins. This enabled us to predict the stellar variability effects on the age-activity diagram, and consequently, to estimate the chromospheric age uncertainties that are due to the same phenomena. The age-activity relation is still statistically significant up to ages around 6-7 Gyr, in agreement with previous works using open clusters and field stars with precise ages. \\
 Conclusions: Our research confirms that Ca II H \&amp; K lines remain a useful chromospheric evolution tracer until stars reach ages of at least 6-7 Gyr. We found evidence that for the most homogenous set of old stars, the chromospheric activity indices seem to continue to decrease after the solar age toward the end of the main sequence. Our results indicate that a significant part of the scatter observed in the age-activity relation of solar twins can be attributed to stellar cycle modulations effects. The Sun seems to have a normal activity level and variability for its age.

However, in the light of Kepler data, the presence of apparently old and fast rotators that do not obey the usual gyrochronology relations led to the hypothesis of weakened magnetic breaking in some stars. In this letter, we constrain the solar rotation evolutionary track using solar twins. Predicted rotational periods as a function of mass, age, [Fe/H], and given critical Rossby number (Ro\textsubscript{crit}) were estimated for the entire rotational sample. Our analysis favours the smooth rotational evolution scenario and suggests that if the magnetic weakened breaking scenario takes place at all, it should arise after Ro\textsubscript{crit} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 2.29 or ages {$\greaterequivlnt$}5.3 Gyr (at 95 per cent confidence level).},

We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets.

This value matches our theoretical expectations based on Laplace relations and places TRAPPIST-1h as the seventh member of a complex chain, with three-body resonances linking every member. We find that TRAPPIST-1h has a radius of 0.715 Earth radii and an equilibrium temperature of 169 K, placing it at the snow line. We have also measured the rotational period of the star at 3.3 d and detected a number of flares consistent with an active, middle-aged, late M dwarf.},

  abstract = {Understanding differential rotation of Sun-like stars is of great importance for insight into the angular momentum transport in these stars. One means of gaining such information is that of asteroseismology. By a forward modeling approach we analyze in a qualitative manner the impact of different differential rotation profiles on the splittings of p-mode oscillation frequencies. The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are identified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle. We find that in general it is not likely that asteroseismology can be used to make an unambiguous distinction between a rotation profile such as, e.g., a conical Sun-like profile and a cylindrical profile. In addition, it seems unlikely that asteroseismology of Sun-like stars will result in inferences on the radial profile of the differential rotation, such as can be done for, e.g., red giants. At best one could possibly obtain the sign of the radial differential rotation gradient. Measurements of the extent of the latitudinal differential from frequency splitting are, however, more promising. One very interesting aspect that could likely be tested from frequency splittings is whether the differential rotation is solar-like or anti-solar-like in nature, in the sense that a solar-like profile has an equator rotating faster than the poles.},

From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases the amount of potential light curves by a factor of {$\geq$}slant 10.

Modelling of the extracted parameters is performed by using grid-based methods using average parameters and individual frequencies together with spectroscopic parameters. For the target selection in C3, stars were chosen as in C1 and C2 to cover a wide range in parameter space to better understand the performance and noise characteristics. For C3 we still detected oscillations in 73\% of the observed stars that we proposed. Future K2 campaigns hold great promise for the study of nearby clusters and the chemical evolution and age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in the solar neighbourhood. We expect oscillations to be detected in \textasciitilde 388 short-cadence targets if the K2 mission continues until C18, which will greatly complement the \textasciitilde 500 detections of solar-like oscillations made for short-cadence targets during the nominal Kepler mission.

We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ``peak-bagging'' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations \{\{{$\increment$} \}\}{$\nu$} and {$\delta$} \{{$\nu$} \}\textsubscript{02}; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at \{{$\nu$} \}\textsubscript{\textbackslash max } with \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities.

It has become a powerful method to precisely characterise exoplanet host stars, and as a consequence also the exoplanets themselves. This synergy between asteroseismology and exoplanet science has flourished in large part due to space missions such as \$\textbackslash textit\{Kepler\}\$, which have provided high-quality data that can be used for both types of studies. Perhaps the primary contribution from asteroseismology to the research on transiting exoplanets is the determination of very precise stellar radii that translate into precise planetary radii, but asteroseismology has also proven useful in constraining eccentricities of exoplanets as well as the dynamical architecture of planetary systems. In this contribution, we introduce some basic principles of asteroseismology and review current synergies between the two fields.},

  abstract = {The second Gaia data release (GDR2) provides precise five-parameter astrometric data (positions, proper motions and parallaxes) for an unprecedented amount of sources (more than \$1.3\$ billion, mostly stars). The use of this wealth of astrometric data comes with a specific challenge: how does one properly infer from these data the astrophysical parameters of interest? The main - but not only - focus of this paper is the issue of the estimation of distances from parallaxes, possibly combined with other information. We start with a critical review of the methods traditionally used to obtain distances from parallaxes and their shortcomings. Then we provide guidelines on how to use parallaxes more efficiently to estimate distances by using Bayesian methods. In particular also we show that negative parallaxes, or parallaxes with relatively larger uncertainties still contain valuable information. Finally, we provide examples that show more generally how to use astrometric data for parameter estimation, including the combination of proper motions and parallaxes and the handling of covariances in the uncertainties. The paper contains examples based on simulated Gaia data to illustrate the problems and the solutions proposed. Furthermore, the developments and methods proposed in the paper are linked to a set of tutorials included in the Gaia archive documentation that provide practical examples and a good starting point for the application of the recommendations to actual problems. In all cases the source code for the analysis methods is provided. Our main recommendation is to always treat the derivation of (astro-) physical parameters from astrometric data, in particular when parallaxes are involved, as an inference problem which should preferably be handled with a full Bayesian approach.},

  abstract = {Context. The second data release (DR2) from the European Space Agency mission Gaia took place on April 2018. DR2 included photometry for more than 1.3 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{9} sources in the three bands G, G\textsubscript{BP}, and G\textsubscript{RP}. Even though the Gaia DR2 photometry is very precise, there are currently three alternative definitions of the sensitivity curves that show significative differences. \\
 Aims: The aim of this paper is to improve the quality of the input calibration data to produce new compatible definitions of the G, G\textsubscript{BP}, and G\textsubscript{RP} bands and to identify the reasons for the discrepancies between previous definitions. \\
 Methods: We have searched the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) archive for Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) spectra with G430L+G750L data obtained with wide apertures and combined them with the CALSPEC library to produce a high quality spectral energy distribution (SED) library of 122 stars with a broad range of colors, including three very red stars. This library defines new sensitivity curves for G, G\textsubscript{BP}, and G\textsubscript{RP} using a functional analytical formalism. \\
 Results: The new sensitivity curves are significantly better than the two previous attempts we use as a reference, REV (Evans et al. 2018, A\&amp;A, 616, A4) and WEI (Weiler 2018, A\&amp;A, 616, A17). For G we confirm the existence of a systematic bias in magnitude and correct a color term present in REV. For G\textsubscript{BP} we confirm the need to define two magnitude ranges with different sensitivity curves and measure the cut between them at G\textsubscript{phot} = 10.87 mag with a significant increase in precision. The new curves also fit the data better than either REV or WEI. For G\textsubscript{RP}, our new sensitivity curve fits the STIS spectra better and the differences with previous attempts reside in a systematic effect between ground-based and HST spectral libraries. Additional evidence from color-color diagrams indicate that the new sensitivity curve is more accurate. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of the sensitivity curves because of the current dearth of good-quality red calibrators: adding more to the sample should be a priority before Gaia data release 3 takes place.

The resolution was proposed by the IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy after consulting with a broad spectrum of researchers from the astronomical community. Resolution B2 resolves the long-standing absence of an internationally-adopted zero point for the absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scales. Resolution B2 defines the zero point of the absolute bolometric magnitude scale such that a radiation source with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Bol\}\$ = 0 has luminosity L\$\_\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ = 3.0128e28 W. The zero point of the apparent bolometric magnitude scale (\$m\_\{\textbackslash rm Bol\}\$ = 0) corresponds to irradiance \$f\_\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ = 2.518021002e-8 W/m\$\^2\$. The zero points were chosen so that the nominal solar luminosity (3.828e26 W) adopted by IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Bol\}\$(Sun) = 4.74, the value most commonly adopted in recent literature. The nominal total solar irradiance (1361 W/m\$\^2\$) adopted in IAU 2015 Resolution B3 corresponds approximately to apparent bolometric magnitude \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm bol\}\$(Sun) = -26.832.

Combining the cluster activity data with modern cluster age estimates and analyzing the color dependence of the chromospheric activity age index, we derive an improved activity-age calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs (0.5 mag \&lt; B - V \&lt; 0.9 mag ). We also present a more fundamentally motivated activity-age calibration that relies on conversion of R\textsuperscript{'}\textsubscript{HK} values through the Rossby number to rotation periods and then makes use of improved gyrochronology relations. We demonstrate that our new activity-age calibration has typical age precision of \textasciitilde 0.2 dex for normal solar-type dwarfs aged between the Hyades and the Sun (\textasciitilde 0.6-4.5 Gyr). Inferring ages through activity-rotation-age relations accounts for some color-dependent effects and systematically improves the age estimates (albeit only slightly). We demonstrate that coronal activity as measured through the fractional X-ray luminosity (R\textsubscript{X} = L\textsubscript{X}/L\textsubscript{bol}) has nearly the same age- and rotation-inferring capability as chromospheric activity measured through R\textsuperscript{'}\textsubscript{HK}. As a first application of our calibrations, we provide new activity-derived age estimates for a volume-limited sample of the 108 solar-type field dwarfs within 16 pc.},

Prior to the launch of the mission, the properties of Kepler targets were inferred from broadband photometry, leading to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC was later revised in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog, based on literature values and an asteroseismic analysis of stars that were unclassified in the KIC. Here, we present an asteroseismic analysis of 45,400 stars that were classified as dwarfs in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog. We found that around 2\% of the sample shows acoustic modes in the typical frequency range that put them in the red-giant category rather than the cool dwarf category. We analyze the asteroseismic properties of these stars, derive their surface gravities, masses, and radii, and present updated effective temperatures and distances. We show that the sample is significantly fainter than the previously known oscillating giants in the Kepler field, with the faintest stars reaching down to a Kepler magnitude of Kp {$\sim$} 16. We demonstrate that 404 stars are at distances beyond 5 kpc and that the stars are significantly less massive than for the original Kepler red-giant sample, consistent with a population of distant halo giants. A comparison with a galactic population model shows that up to 40 stars might be genuine halo giants, which would increase the number of known asteroseismic halo stars by a factor of 4. The detections presented here will provide a valuable sample for galactic archeology studies.},

In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are {$\sim$}27\% in radius, {$\sim$}17\% in mass, and {$\sim$}51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved \{log\}g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants.

We demonstrate that this new formulation explains why the lowest mass stars are observed to maintain rapid rotation for much longer than solar-mass stars, and simultaneously why older populations exhibit a sequence of slowly rotating stars, in which the low-mass stars rotate more slowly than solar-mass stars. The model also reproduces some previously unexplained features in the period-mass diagram for the Kepler field, notably: the particular shape of the "upper envelope" of the distribution, suggesting that \textasciitilde 95\% of Kepler field stars with measured rotation periods are younger than \textasciitilde 4 Gyr; and the shape of the "lower envelope," corresponding to the location where stars transition between magnetically saturated and unsaturated regimes.},

  abstract = {Context. Tidal interactions between planets and their host stars are not 
well understood, but may be an important factor in their formation,
structure, and evolution. Previous studies suggest that these tidal
interactions may be responsible for discrepancies between the ages of
exoplanet host stars estimated using stellar models (isochronal age
estimates) and age estimates based on the stars' rotation periods
(gyrochronological age estimates). Recent improvements in our
understanding of the rotational evolution of single stars and a
substantial increase in the number of exoplanet host stars with accurate
rotation period measurements make it worthwhile to revisit this
question. Aims: Our aim is to determine whether the
gyrochronological age estimates for transiting exoplanet host stars with
accurate rotation period measurements are consistent with their
isochronal age estimates, and whether this is indicative of tidal
interaction between the planets and their host stars. Methods: We
have compiled a sample of 28 transiting exoplanet host stars with
measured rotation periods, including two stars (HAT-P-21 and WASP-5) for
which the rotation period based on the light curve modulation is
reported here for the first time. We use our recently developed Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo method to determine the joint posterior
distribution for the mass and age of each star in the sample. We extend
our Bayesian method to include a calculation of the posterior
distribution of the gyrochronological age estimate that accounts for the
uncertainties in the mass and age, the strong correlation between these
values, and the uncertainties in the mass-rotation-age calibration. Results: The gyrochronological age estimate ({$\tau$}gyro) is
significantly lower than the isochronal age estimate for about half of
the stars in our sample. Tidal interactions between the star and planet
are a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in some cases, but not
all. The distribution of {$\tau$}gyro values is evenly spread
from very young ages up to a maximum value of a few Gyr, i.e. there is
no obvious pile-up of stars at very low or very high values of
{$\tau$}gyro as might be expected if some evolutionary or
selection effect were biasing the age distribution of the stars in this
sample. There is no clear correlation between {$\tau$}gyro and
the strength of the tidal force on the star due to the innermost planet.
There is clear evidence that the isochronal age estimates for some
K-type stars are too high, and this may also be the case for some G-type
stars. This may be the result of magnetic inhibition of convection. The
densities of HAT-P-11 and WASP-84 are too high to be reproduced by any
stellar models within the observed constraints on effective temperature
and metallicity. These stars may have strongly enhanced helium
abundances. There is currently no satisfactory explanation for the
discrepancy between the young age for CoRoT-2 estimated from either
gyrochronology or its high lithium abundance, and the extremely old age
for its K-type stellar companion inferred from its very low X-ray flux.
 Conclusions: There is now strong evidence that the
gyrochronological age estimates for some transiting exoplanet host stars
are significantly lower than the isochronal age estimates, but it is not
always clear that this is good evidence for tidal interactions between
the star and the planet.},

Such sharp features inside the acoustic cavity of the star, which we call acoustic glitches, create small oscillatory deviations from the uniform spacing of frequencies in a sequence of oscillation modes with the same spherical harmonic degree. We use these oscillatory signals to determine the acoustic locations of such features in 19 solar-type stars observed by the Kepler mission. Four independent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequencies themselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of the small and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and the second helium ionization zone. Despite the significantly different methods of analysis, good agreement was found between the results of these four groups, barring a few cases. These results also agree reasonably well with the locations of these layers in representative models of the stars. These results firmly establish the presence of the oscillatory signals in the asteroseismic data and the viability of several techniques to determine the location of acoustic glitches inside stars.},

We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyrs, based on the isochrones of Barnes (2007), Mamajek \& Hillenbrand (2008) and Meibom et al.

We report rotation periods for 441 stars within this field and determine their cluster membership and binarity based on a decade-long radial velocity survey, proper-motion measurements, and multiband photometric observations. We find that 310 of the stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. The distribution of rotation periods for cluster members span more than 2 orders of magnitude from \textasciitilde 0.1 to 15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the timespan of the survey. With an age between the zero-age main sequence and the Hyades, and with \textasciitilde 6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80\% of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color-period plane, and define clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The M35 color-period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition between the two rotational states, of \textasciitilde 60 Myr and \textasciitilde 140 Myr for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades, confirm the Skumanich spin-down dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the rotational sequences in the M35 color-period diagram support the use of rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use such gyrochronology to determine "gyro-ages" for M35 from 134 Myr to 161 Myr. We use the M35 data to evaluate new color dependences for the rotational isochrones. WIYN Open Cluster Study.

  abstract = {The ages of the most common stars--low-mass (cool) stars like the Sun, and smaller--are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use stellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to measure. The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.},

  abstract = {In case of pre-main sequence objects, the only way to determine age and mass is by fitting theoretical isochrones on color-magnitude (alternatively luminosity-temperature) diagrams. Since young stellar objects exhibit photometric variability over wide range in magnitude and colors, the age and mass determined by fitting isochrones is expected to be inaccurate, if not erroneous. These in turn will badly affect any study carried out on age spread and process of star formation. Since we have carried out very extensive photometric observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), we decided to use our multi-band data to explore the influence of variability in determining mass and age of cluster members. In this study, we get the amplitudes of the photometric variability in V, R, and I optical bands of a sample of 346 ONC members and use it to investigate how the variability affects the inferred masses and ages and if it alone can take account for the age spread among the ONC members reported by earlier studies. We find that members that show periodic and smooth photometric rotational modulation have their masses and ages unaffected by variability. On other hand, we found that members with periodic but very scattered photometric rotational modulation and members with irregular variability have their masses and ages significantly affected. Moreover, using Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams we find that the observed I band photometric variability can take account of only a fraction (about 50\%) of the inferred age spread, whereas the V band photometric variability is large enough to mask any age spread.},

In the past, ground-based data on solar-like oscillations have emerged slowly enough that we could try to model one star at a time. NASA's Kepler mission is now producing asteroseismic data for hundreds of stars every few months, so a hands-on approach is a luxury we can no longer afford. We have developed a stellar model-fitting pipeline, which employs a parallel genetic algorithm to match observations from the Kepler mission. We have validated the method using Sun-as-a-star observations as well as data from a wide variety of solar-type stars. The pipeline is now available through the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP), a Science Gateway website tied to supercomputing resources on the TeraGrid.

We use previously published asteroseismic and spectroscopic data sets to provide a uniform analysis of 42 solar-type Kepler targets from the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically doubles the precision of the asteroseismic radius, mass, and age compared to grid-based modeling of the global oscillation properties, and improves the precision of the radius and mass by about a factor of three over empirical scaling relations. We demonstrate the utility of the derived properties with several applications.},

measurements for the sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets that were used to establish the new rotation-age relations. We use these

As a consequence, the reliability of asteroseismic modeling has been limited by the precision of additional constraints from high-resolution spectroscopy and parallax measurements. A precise luminosity is particularly useful to minimize potential biases due to the intrinsic correlation between stellar mass and initial helium abundance. We have applied the latest version of the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) to the complete Kepler data sets for 30 stars with known rotation rates and chromospheric activity levels. We compare the stellar properties derived with and without the measured parallaxes from the first data release of Gaia.

  abstract = {Nearly half a century has passed since the initial indications that stellar rotation slows while chromospheric activity weakens with a power-law dependence on age, the so-called Skumanich relations. Subsequent characterization of the mass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of gyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an empirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular momentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field produced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that the global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence lifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic field, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of gyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur near the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis forces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by differential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from Barnes (2007) to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations that were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that chromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for older stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate activity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.},

Pioneering work at the Mount Wilson Observatory demonstrated that other sun-like stars also show regular activity cycles, and suggested two possible relationships between the rotation rate and the length of the cycle. Neither of these relationships correctly describe the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation. Recent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that the Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional phase that occurs in all middle-aged stars. Motivated by these developments, we identify the manifestation of this magnetic transition in the best available data on stellar cycles. We propose a reinterpretation of previously published observations to suggest that the solar cycle may be growing longer on stellar evolutionary timescales, and that the cycle might disappear sometime in the next 0.8-2.4 Gyr. Future tests of this hypothesis will come from ground-based activity monitoring of Kepler targets that span the magnetic transition, and from asteroseismology with the TESS mission to determine precise masses and ages for bright stars with known cycles.},

  abstract = {Context. The astrometric solution for Gaia aims to determine at least five parameters for each star, representing its position, parallax, and proper motion, together with appropriate estimates of their
uncertainties and correlations. This requires at least five distinct observations per star. In the early data reductions the number of observations may be insufficient for a five-parameter solution, and even after the full mission many stars will remain under-observed, including faint stars at the detection limit and transient objects. In such cases it is reasonable to determine only the two position parameters. The formal uncertainties of such a two-parameter solution would however grossly underestimate the actual errors in position, due to the
neglected parallax and proper motion. Aims: We aim to develop a recipe to calculate sensible formal uncertainties that can be used in all cases of under-observed stars. Methods: Prior information about the typical ranges of stellar parallaxes and proper motions is incorporated in the astrometric solution by means of Bayes' rule. Numerical simulations based on the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot (GUMS) are used to investigate how the prior influences the actual errors and formal uncertainties when different amounts of Gaia observations are available. We develop a criterion for the optimum choice of priors, apply it to a wide range of cases, and derive a global approximation of the optimum prior as a function of magnitude and galactic coordinates. Results: The feasibility of the Bayesian approach is demonstrated through global astrometric solutions of simulated Gaia observations. With an appropriate prior it is possible to derive sensible positions with realistic error estimates for any number of available observations. Even though this recipe works also for well-observed stars it should not be used where a good five-parameter astrometric solution can be obtained without a prior. Parallaxes and proper motions from a solution using priors are always biased and should not be used.},

Aims: We investigate which information on the observed population can be recovered by the distribution of the observed seismic constraints: the frequency of maximum oscillation power ({$\nu\_$}max) and the large frequency separation ({$\increment\nu$}). \\
Methods: We propose to use the observed distribution of {$\nu\_$}max and of {$\increment\nu$} as a tool for investigating the properties of galactic red-giant stars through comparison with simulated distributions based on synthetic stellar populations. \\
Results: We can clearly identify the bulk of the red giants observed by CoRoT as red-clump stars, i.e. post-flash core-He-burning stars. The distribution of {$\nu\_$}max and of {$\increment\nu$} gives us access to the distribution of the stellar radius and mass, and thus represent a most promising probe of the age and star formation rate of the disk, and of the mass-loss rate during the red-giant branch. \\
Conclusions: CoRoT observations are supplying seismic constraints for the most populated class of He-burning stars in the galactic disk. This opens a new access gate to probing the properties of red-giant stars that, coupled with classical observations, promises to extend our knowledge of these advanced phases of stellar evolution and to add relevant constraints to models of composite stellar populations in the Galaxy.

We analyse the frequency dependence of the large frequency separation and second frequency differences, as well as the behaviour of the large frequency separation obtained with the envelope auto-correlation function. We find evidence for a periodic component in the oscillation frequencies, i.e. the seismic signature of a sharp structure variation in HR7349.

Here, we show that solar-like pulsating red giants represent a well-populated class of accurate distance indicators, spanning a large age range, which can be used to map and date the Galactic disc in the regions probed by observations made by the CoRoT and Kepler space telescopes. When combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of such evolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but also provide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxies for the ages of the stars. As a first application, we consider red giants observed by CoRoT in two different parts of the Milky Way, and determine precise distances for{\~ }2000 stars spread across nearly 15 000 pc of the Galactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solar neighbourhood. We find significant differences in the mass distributions of these two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models of the Milky Way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in the distribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. In the future, the availability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will not only improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints on age-velocity and age-metallicity relations at different Galactocentric radii and heights from the plane.},

  abstract = {Undoubtedly one the highlights of the Kepler asteroseismology programme has been the detection of solar-like oscillations in giants belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811. The availability of such constraints has made it possible to infer precise stellar properties (e.g. radius, mass, evolutionary state, age) on a star-by-star basis.These constraints give us a ``new pair of eyes'' to look at clusters, and they open several exciting opportunities. Based on a detailed analysis of the complete set of 4-years-long Kepler data, we present clear evidence for stars that have undergone non-standard evolution (evolved blue stragglers, low-mass Li-rich stars). We then illustrate the potential of integrated-mass-loss and mass-loss-dispersion measurements in both NGC6791 and NGC6819, which suggest a small true mass scatter among the red-clump stars and thus a very small mass-loss dispersion.We will then show examples of how our analysis based on individual-mode frequencies, as opposed to average seismic parameters and scaling relations, allow us to determine with higher accuracy stellar properties, and to probe features in the deep stellar interior (i.e. acoustic glitches related to Helium ionisation, properties of near-core mixing in the He-core-burning phase).Finally, we will discuss the prospects for seismic analyses of other clusters, in particular the globular cluster M4 which could reveal new insights into mass-loss dispersion and its effect on the horizontal-branch morphology.},

Tests against independent estimates of these properties are however scarce, especially in the metal-poor regime. Here, we report the detection of solar-like oscillations in eight stars belonging to the red-giant branch (RGB) and red-horizontal branch (RHB) of the globular cluster M4. The detections were made in photometric observations from the K2 Mission during its Campaign 2. Making use of independent constraints on the distance, we estimate masses of the eight stars by utilizing different combinations of seismic and non-seismic inputs. When introducing a correction to the {$\increment\nu$} scaling relation as suggested by stellar models, for RGB stars we find excellent agreement with the expected masses from isochrone fitting, and with a distance modulus derived using independent methods. The offset with respect to independent masses is lower, or comparable with, the uncertainties on the average RGB mass (4-10 per cent, depending on the combination of constraints used). Our results lend confidence to asteroseismic masses in the metal-poor regime. We note that a larger sample will be needed to allow more stringent tests to be made of systematic uncertainties in all the observables (both seismic and non-seismic), and to explore the properties of RHB stars, and of different populations in the cluster.},

  abstract = {Galactic archaeology - the study of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way by reconstructing its past from its current constituents - requires precise and accurate knowledge of stellar parameters for as many stars as possible. To achieve this a number of large spectroscopic surveys have been undertaken and are still ongoing. So far consortia carrying out the different spectroscopic surveys have used different tools to determine stellar parameters of stars from their derived effective temperatures (Teff), surface gravities (log g) and metallicities ([Fe/H]) possibly combined with photometric, astrometric, interferometric or asteroseismic information. Here we aim to homogenise the stellar characterisation by applying a unified tool to a large set of publicly available spectrophotometric data. We use spectroscopic data from a variety of large surveys combined with infra-red photometry from 2MASS and AllWISE and compare these in a Bayesian manner with PARSEC isochrones to derive probability density functions (PDFs) for stellar masses, ages and distances. We treat PDFs of pre-helium-core burning, helium-core burning and post helium-core burning solutions as well as different peaks in multi-modal PDFs (i.e. each unimodal sub-PDF) of the different evolutionary phases separately. For over 2.5 million stars we report mass, age and distance estimate for each evolutionary phase and unimodal sub-PDF. We report Gaussian, skewed Gaussian, truncated Gaussian, modified truncated exponential distribution or truncated Student's t-distribution functions to represent each sub-PDF, allowing to reconstruct detailed PDFs. Comparisons with stellar parameter estimates from the literature show good agreement within uncertainties. We present UniDAM - the unified tool applicable to spectrophotometric data of different surveys to obtain a homogenised set of stellar parameters.},

We crossmatched the Gaia identifications with the observations collected by the Kepler space telescope. We inspected the light curves visually, then calculated the relative Fourier coefficients and period ratios for the single- and double-mode K2 RR Lyrae stars to further classify them. We identified 1443 and 41 stars classified as RR Lyrae or Cepheid variables in DR2 in the targeted observations of the two missions and 263 more RR Lyre targets in the Full-Frame Images (FFI) of the original mission and provide the crossmatch of these sources. We conclude that the RR Lyrae catalog has a completeness between 70-78\%, and provide a purity estimate between 92-98\% (targeted observations) with lower limits of 75\% (FFI stars) and 51\% (K2 worst-case scenario). The low number of Cepheids prevents us from drawing detailed conclusions but the purity of the DR2 sample is estimated to be around 66\%.},

We perform an analysis of more than 4\textbackslash,600 CoRoT light curves to extract as much information as possible. We take into account the characteristics of the star sample and of the method in order to provide asteroseismic results as unbiased as possible. We also study and compare the properties of red giants of two opposite regions of the Galaxy. We analyze the time series with the envelope autocorrelation function in order to extract precise asteroseismic parameters with reliable error bars. We examine first the mean large frequency separation of solar-like oscillations and the frequency of maximum seismic amplitude, then the parameters of the excess power envelope. With the additional information of the effective temperature, we derive the stellar mass and radius. We have identified more than 1\textbackslash,800 red giants among the 4\textbackslash,600 light curves and have obtained accurate distributions of the stellar parameters for about 930 targets. We were able to reliably measure the mass and radius of several hundred red giants. We have derived precise information on the stellar population distribution and on the red clump. Comparison between the stars observed in two different fields shows that the stellar asteroseismic properties are globally similar, but with different characteristics for red-clump stars. This study shows the efficiency of statistical asteroseismology: validating scaling relations allows us to infer fundamental stellar parameters, to derive precise information on the red-giant evolution and interior structure and to analyze and compare stellar populations from different fields.},

  abstract = {Context. The CoRoT mission has provided thousands of red-giant light curves. The analysis of their solar-like oscillations allows us to characterize their stellar properties. \\
 Aims: Up to now, the global seismic parameters of the pressure modes have been unable to distinguish red-clump giants from members of the red-giant branch. As recently done with Kepler red giants, we intend to analyze and use the so-called mixed modes to determine the evolutionary status of the red giants observed with CoRoT. We also aim at deriving different seismic characteristics depending on evolution. \\
 Methods: The complete identification of the pressure eigenmodes provided by the red-giant universal oscillation pattern allows us to aim at the mixed modes surrounding the {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 expected eigenfrequencies. A dedicated method based on the envelope autocorrelation function is proposed to analyze their period separation. \\
 Results: We have identified the mixed-mode signature separation thanks to their pattern that is compatible with the asymptotic law of gravity modes. We have shown that, independent of any modeling, the g-mode spacings help to distinguish the evolutionary status of a red-giant star. We then report the different seismic and fundamental properties of the stars, depending on their evolutionary status. In particular, we show that high-mass stars of the secondary clump present very specific seismic properties. We emphasize that stars belonging to the clump were affected by significant mass loss. We also note significant population and/or evolution differences in the different fields observed by CoRoT.

  abstract = {Context. The space mission Kepler provides us with long and uninterrupted photometric time series of red giants. This allows us to examine their seismic global properties and to compare these with theoretical predictions. \\
 Aims: We aim to describe the oscillation power excess observed in red giant oscillation spectra with global seismic parameters, and to investigate empirical scaling relations governing these parameters. From these scalings relations, we derive new physical properties of red giant oscillations. \\
 Methods: Various different methods were compared in order to validate the processes and to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a single method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant global asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the background signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of the power excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility of non-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed, which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillation spectrum. \\
 Results: The comparison of the different methods has shown the important role of the way the background is modelled. The convergence reached by the collaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning the oscillation power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the influence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of helium burning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strong mass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none of the amplitude scaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observed mode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel, the degree-dependent mode visibility exhibits important variations. Both effects seem related to the significant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. A family of red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties are analyzed. \\
 Conclusions: The clear correlation between the power densities of the background signal and of the stellar oscillation induces important consequences to be considered for deriving a reliable theoretical relation of the mode amplitude. As a by-product of this work, we have verified that red giant asteroseismology delivers new insights for stellar and Galactic physics, given the evidence for mass loss at the tip of the red giant branch.

  abstract = {Context. There are now more than 22 months of long-cadence data available for thousands of red giants observed with the Kepler space mission. Consequently, we are able to clearly resolve fine details in their oscillation spectra and see many components of the mixed modes that probe the stellar core. \\
 Aims: We report for the first time a parametric fit to the pattern of the {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 mixed modes in red giants, which is a powerful tool to identify gravity-dominated mixed modes. With these modes, which share the characteristics of pressure and gravity modes, we are able to probe directly the helium core and the surrounding shell where hydrogen is burning. \\
 Methods: We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period \'echelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes. \\
 Results: The asymptotic relation for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of {$\mathscr{l}$} = 3 modes, of {$\mathscr{l}$} = 2 mixed modes, for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 rotational splittings. \\
 Conclusions: The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the mean large separation.

 Aims: We aim to measure the rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations for rotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. \\
 Methods: We have developed a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotational splittings in a large number of red giants. Ensemble asteroseismology, namely the examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of their evolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. \\
 Results: We have measured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have also shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under the assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, we observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump stars compared to the red giant branch. We also show that, at fixed stellar radius, the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. \\
 Conclusions: Ensemble asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: our interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusion that the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giant phase. The slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. This spinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured in white dwarfs.

  abstract = {With the space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler, a large amount of asteroseismic data is now available. So-called global oscillation parameters are inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensemble asteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. The mean large separation is such a key parameter. It is therefore crucial to measure it with the highest accuracy. As the conditions of measurement of the large separation do not coincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressions used for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. Then, we examine the consequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the mean large separation. The analysis is focused on radial modes. We use series of radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational values of the large separation. We propose a simple formulation to correct the observed value of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic counterpart. We prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structure discontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to red giants. Our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in the theoretical development. High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra derived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better described with the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order term is responsible for the curvature observed in the \textbackslash 'echelle diagrams used for analysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation. Taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providing more accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.},

  abstract = {Context. Asteroseismology allows us to probe the physical conditions inside the core of red giant stars. This process relies on the properties of the global oscillations with a mixed character that are highly sensitive to the physical properties of the core. However, overlapping rotational splittings and mixed-mode spacings result in complex structures in the mixed-mode pattern, which severely complicates its identification and the measurement of the asymptotic period spacing. \\
 Aims: This work aims at disentangling the rotational splittings from the mixed-mode spacings in order to open the way to a fully automated analysis of large data sets. \\
 Methods: An analytical development of the mixed-mode asymptotic expansion is used to derive the period spacing between two consecutive mixed modes. The \'echelle diagrams constructed with the appropriately stretched periods are used to exhibit the structure of the gravity modes and of the rotational splittings. \\
 Results: We propose a new view of the mixed-mode oscillation pattern based on corrected periods, called stretched periods, that mimic the evenly spaced gravity-mode pattern. This provides a direct understanding of all oscillation components, even in the case of rapid rotation. In this way, the measurement of the asymptotic period spacing and the signature of the structural glitches on mixed modes can be performed easily. \\
 Conclusions: This work makes it possible to derive all seismic global parameters in an automated way, including the identification of the different rotational multiplets and the measurement of the rotational splitting, even when this splitting is significantly larger than the period spacing. Revealing buoyancy glitches provides a detailed view of the radiative core.},

  abstract = {Context: The observations carried out by the space missions CoRoT and Kepler provide a large set of asteroseismic data. Their analysis requires an efficient procedure first to determine if a star reliably shows solar-like oscillations, second to measure the so-called large separation, third to estimate the asteroseismic information that can be retrieved from the Fourier spectrum.\\
 Aims: In this paper we develop a procedure based on the autocorrelation of the seismic Fourier spectrum that is capable of providing measurements of the large and small frequency separations. The performance of the autocorrelation method needs to be assessed and quantified. We therefore searched for criteria able to predict the output that one can expect from the analysis by autocorrelation of a seismic time series. \\
 Methods: First, the autocorrelation is properly scaled to take into account the contribution of white noise. Then we use the null hypothesis H\textsubscript{0} test to assess the reliability of the autocorrelation analysis. Calculations based on solar and CoRoT time series are performed to quantify the performance as a function of the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal.\\
 Results: We obtain an empirical relation for the performance of the autocorrelation method. We show that the precision of the method increases with the observation length, and with the mean seismic amplitude-to-background ratio of the pressure modes to the power 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.05. We propose an automated determination of the large separation, whose reliability is quantified by the H\textsubscript{0} test. We apply this method to analyze red giants observed by CoRoT. We estimate the expected performance for photometric time series of the Kepler mission. We demonstrate that the method makes it possible to distinguish {$\mathscr{l}$} = 0 from {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 modes.\\
 Conclusions: The envelope autocorrelation function (EACF) has proven to be very powerful for the determination of the large separation in noisy asteroseismic data, since it enables us to quantify the precision of the performance of different measurements: mean large separation, variation of the large separation with frequency, small separation and degree identification.

  abstract = {Asteroseismology has been impressively boosted during the last decade mainly thanks to space missions such as Kepler/K2 and CoRoT. This has a large impact, in particular, in exoplanetary sciences since the accurate characterization of the exoplanets is convoluted in most cases with the characterization of their hosting star. Until the expected launch of the ESA mission PLATO 2.0, there is almost a decade where only two important missions will provide short-cadence high-precision photometric time-series: NASA--TESS and ESA--CHEOPS missions, both having high capabilities for exoplanetary sciences. In this work, we want to explore the asteroseismic potential of CHEOPS time-series. Following the works done for estimating the asteroseismic potential of Kepler and TESS, we have analyzed the probability of detecting solar-like pulsations using CHEOPS light-curves. Since CHEOPS will collect runs with observational times from hours up to a few days, we have analyzed the accuracy and precision we can obtain for the estimation of nu\_max, the only asteroseismic observable we can recover using CHEOPS observations. Finally, we have analyzed the impact of knowing nu\_max in the characterization of exoplanet host stars. Using CHEOPS light-curves with the expected observational times we can determine nu\_max for massive G and F-type stars from late Main Sequence on, and for F, G, and K-type stars from post-Main Sequence on with an uncertainty lower than a 5\%. For magnitudes V{$<$}12 and observational times from eight hours up to two days, the HR zone of potential detectability changes. The determination of nu\_max leads to an internal age uncertainty reduction in the characterization of exoplanet host stars from 52\% to 38\%; mass uncertainty reduction from 2.1\% to 1.8\%; radius uncertainty reduction from 1.8\% to 1.6\%; density uncertainty reduction from 5.6\% to 4.7\%, in our best scenarios.},

In many cases, there is a subset of reference objects for which the stellar labels are known with high(er) fidelity. We take advantage of this with The Cannon, a new data-driven approach for determining stellar labels from spectroscopic data. The Cannon learns from the ``known'' labels of reference stars how the continuum-normalized spectra depend on these labels by fitting a flexible model at each wavelength; then, The Cannon uses this model to derive labels for the remaining survey stars. We illustrate The Cannon by training the model on only 542 stars in 19 clusters as reference objects, with \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}, \{log\} g, and [\{Fe\}/\{\{H\}\}] as the labels, and then applying it to the spectra of 55,000 stars from APOGEE DR10. The Cannon is very accurate. Its stellar labels compare well to the stars for which APOGEE pipeline (ASPCAP) labels are provided in DR10, with rms differences that are basically identical to the stated ASPCAP uncertainties. Beyond the reference labels, The Cannon makes no use of stellar models nor any line-list, but needs a set of reference objects that span label-space. The Cannon performs well at lower signal-to-noise, as it delivers comparably good labels even at one-ninth the APOGEE observing time. We discuss the limitations of The Cannon and its future potential, particularly, to bring different spectroscopic surveys onto a consistent scale of stellar labels.},

An analogous analysis among pairs of \${$>$}1000\$ field stars shows that highly significant abundance differences in the 20-dimensional space can be established for the vast majority of these pairs, and that the APOGEE-based abundance measurements have high discriminating power. However, pairs of field stars whose abundances are indistinguishable even at 0.03\textasciitilde dex precision exist: \$\textbackslash sim 0.3\$ percent of all field star pairs, and \$\textbackslash sim 1.0\$ percent of field star pairs at the same (solar) metallicity [Fe/H] = \$0 \textbackslash pm 0.02\$. Most of these pairs are presumably not birth siblings from the same cluster, but rather doppelganger. Our analysis implies that 'chemical tagging' in the strict sense, identifying birth siblings for typical disk stars through their abundance similarity alone, will not work with such data. However, our approach shows that abundances have extremely valuable information for probabilistic chemo-orbital modeling and combined with velocities, we have identified new cluster members from the field.},

  abstract = {Aims: We aim to measure the starspot rotation periods of active 
stars in the Kepler field as a function of spectral type and to extend
reliable rotation measurements from F-, G-, and K-type to M-type stars.
 Methods: Using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram we searched more than
150 000 stellar light curves for periodic brightness variations. We
analyzed periods between 1 and 30 days in eight consecutive Kepler
quarters, where 30 days is an estimated maximum for the validity of the
PDC\_MAP data correction pipeline. We selected stable rotation periods,
i.e., periods that do not vary from the median by more than one day in
at least six of the eight quarters. We averaged the periods for each
stellar spectral class according to B - V color and compared the results
to archival vsini data, using stellar radii estimates from the Kepler
Input Catalog. Results: We report on the stable starspot rotation
periods of 12 151 Kepler stars. We find good agreement between starspot
velocities and vsini data for all F-, G- and early K-type stars. The 795
M-type stars in our sample have a median rotation period of 15.4 days.
We find an excess of M-type stars with periods less than 7.5 days that
are potentially fast-rotating and fully convective. Measuring
photometric variability in multiple Kepler quarters appears to be a
straightforward and reliable way to determine the rotation periods of a
large sample of active stars, including late-type stars.

  abstract = {Context. Rotational shear in Sun-like stars is thought to be an important ingredient in models of stellar dynamos. Thanks to helioseismology, rotation in the Sun is characterized well, but the interior rotation profiles of other Sun-like stars are not so well constrained. Until recently, measurements of rotation in Sun-like stars have focused on the mean rotation, but little progress has been made on measuring or even placing limits on differential rotation. \\
 Aims: Using asteroseismic measurements of rotation we aim to constrain the radial shear in five Sun-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission: KIC 004914923, KIC 005184732, KIC 006116048, KIC 006933899, and KIC 010963065. \\
 Methods: We used stellar structure models for these five stars from previous works. These models provide the mass density, mode eigenfunctions, and the convection zone depth, which we used to compute the sensitivity kernels for the rotational frequency splitting of the modes. We used these kernels as weights in a parametric model of the stellar rotation profile of each star, where we allowed different rotation rates for the radiative interior and the convective envelope. This parametric model was incorporated into a fit to the oscillation power spectrum of each of the five Kepler stars. This fit included a prior on the rotation of the envelope, estimated from the rotation of surface magnetic activity measured from the photometric variability. \\
 Results: The asteroseismic measurements without the application of priors are unable to place meaningful limits on the radial shear. Using a prior on the envelope rotation enables us to constrain the interior rotation rate and thus the radial shear. In the five cases that we studied, the interior rotation rate does not differ from the envelope by more than approximately {$\pm$} 30\%. Uncertainties in the rotational splittings are too large to unambiguously determine the sign of the radial shear.},

  abstract = {During the solar magnetic activity cycle the emergence latitudes of sunspots change, leading to the well-known butterfly diagram. This phenomenon is poorly understood for other stars as starspot latitudes are generally unknown. The related changes in starspot rotation rates caused by latitudinal differential rotation can however be measured. Using the set of 3093 Kepler stars with activity cycles identified by Reinhold et al. (2017), we aim to study the temporal change in starspot rotation rates over magnetic activity cycles, and how this relates to the activity level, mean rotation rate, and effective temperature of the star. We measure the photometric variability as a proxy for the magnetic activity and the spot rotation rate in each quarter over the duration of the Kepler mission. We phase-fold these measurements with the cycle period. We perform averages over stars with comparable mean rotation rates and effective temperature at fixed activity-cycle phases. We detect a clear correlation between the variation of activity level and the variation of the starspot rotation rate. The sign and amplitude of this correlation depends on the mean stellar rotation and, to a lesser extent, on the effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars (with periods between 15-28 days) the starspot rotation rates are clearly anti-correlated with the level of activity during the activity cycles. A transition is seen at periods of 10-15 days, where stars with effective temperature above 4200K instead show positive correlation. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a stellar "butterfly diagram", but these appear different from the Sun's as the starspot rotation rates are either in phase or anti-phase with the activity level. Alternatively, the activity cycles seen by Kepler are short (around 2.5 years) and may therefore be secondary cycles, perhaps analogous to the solar quasi-biennial oscillations.},

We present an independent modelling of each star in this binary system. Stellar models generated using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) were fitted to both the observed individual frequencies and complementary spectroscopic parameters. The individual theoretical oscillation frequencies for the corresponding stellar models were obtained using GYRE as the pulsation code. A Bayesian approach was applied to find the probability distribution functions of the stellar parameters using AIMS (Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale) as the optimisation code.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M \textsubscript{sun} star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors.

Stars with \$M{$<$}8\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\}\$ become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernovae properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernova, pulsational pair-instability supernova, and the formation of stellar mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability of importing multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, and four new software tools -- MESAWeb, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org -- to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

In the case of the study of acoustic glitches there are no publicly available tools and most existing ones require a deep knowledge of their implementation. In this work a tool is presented that aims to both simplify the interaction with the user and also be capable of working automatically to determine properties of acoustic glitches from seismic data of solar-like stars. This tool is shown to work with both the Sun and other solar analogs but also shows that are still severe limitations to the methods used, when considering smaller datasets.},

  abstract = {The analysis of photometric time series in the context of transiting planet surveys suffers from the presence of stellar signals, often dubbed `stellar noise'. These signals, caused by stellar oscillations and granulation, can usually be disregarded for main-sequence stars, as the stellar contributions average out when phase-folding the light curve. For evolved stars, however, the amplitudes of such signals are larger and the timescales similar to the transit duration of
short-period planets, requiring that they be modelled alongside the transit. With the promise of TESS delivering of the order of
{$\sim$}105 light curves for stars along the red giant branch, there is a need for a method capable of describing the `stellar noise' while simultaneously modelling an exoplanet's transit. In this work, a Gaussian process regression framework is used to model stellar light curves and the method validated by applying it to TESS-like artificial data. Furthermore, the method is used to characterize the stellar oscillations and granulation of a sample of well-studied Kepler
low-luminosity red giant branch stars. The parameters determined are compared to equivalent ones obtained by modelling the power spectrum of the light curve. Results show that the method presented is capable of describing the stellar signals in the time domain and can also return an accurate and precise measurement of {$\nu$}max, i.e. the
frequency of maximum oscillation amplitude. Preliminary results show that using the method in transit modelling improves the precision and accuracy of the ratio between the planetary and stellar radius,
Rp/R{$\star$}. The method's implementation is

  abstract = {Regular intrinsic brightness variations observed in many stars are caused by pulsations. These pulsations provide information on the global and structural parameters of the star. The pulsation periods range from seconds to years, depending on the compactness of the star and properties of the matter that forms its outer layers. Here, we report the discovery of more than a dozen of previously unknown short-period variable stars: blue large-amplitude pulsators. These objects show very regular brightness variations with periods in the range of 20-40 min and amplitudes of 0.2-0.4 mag in the optical passbands. The phased light curves have a characteristic sawtooth shape, similar to the shape of classical Cepheids and RR Lyrae-type stars pulsating in the fundamental mode. The objects are significantly bluer than main sequence stars observed in the same fields, which indicates that all of them are hot stars. Follow-up spectroscopy confirms a high surface temperature of about 30,000 K. Temperature and colour changes over the cycle prove the pulsational nature of the variables. However, large-amplitude pulsations at such short periods are not observed in any known type of stars, including hot objects. Long-term photometric observations show that the variable stars are very stable over time. Derived rates of period change are of the order of 10\^-7 per year and, in most cases, they are positive. According to pulsation theory, such large-amplitude oscillations may occur in evolved low-mass stars that have inflated helium-enriched envelopes. The evolutionary path that could lead to such stellar configurations remains unknown.},

The spectroscopic parameters provided from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment project are complemented with asteroseismic surface gravities, masses, radii, and mean densities determined by members of the Kepler Asteroseismology Science Consortium. We assess both random and systematic sources of error and include a discussion of sample selection for giants in the Kepler fields. Total uncertainties in the main catalog properties are of the order of 80 K in T \textsubscript{eff}, 0.06 dex in [M/H], 0.014 dex in log g, and 12\% and 5\% in mass and radius, respectively; these reflect a combination of systematic and random errors. Asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones, and we find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities. There are, however, systematic underlying trends with T \textsubscript{eff} and log g. Our effective temperature scale is between 0 and 200 K cooler than that expected from the infrared flux method, depending on the adopted extinction map, which provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric KIC and spectroscopic APOKASC metallicity scales, with increased dispersion in KIC metallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases, and offsets in T \textsubscript{eff} and log g consistent with those derived in the literature. We present mean fitting relations between APOKASC and KIC observables and discuss future prospects, strengths, and limitations of the catalog data.},

Our data includes evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing (\$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash nu\$) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero point of the frequency of maximum power (\$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\$) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipeline-predicted random errors, but 22\textbackslash\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\textbackslash\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\textbackslash\% and 8\textbackslash\% level respectively for RC stars.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {In this brief communication we provide the rationale for and the outcome of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIXth General Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal conversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem addressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants between solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused a proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar luminosity, solar effective temperature, and solar mass parameter) in the literature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the time of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of consistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in 2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary, and fundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on optimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU 2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The resolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are by definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should be understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary properties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to join in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work and publications to help minimize further confusion.},

These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common
proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 33\%
{$\pm$} 2\%, 8\% {$\pm$} 1\%, and 3\% {$\pm$} 1\%, respectively, counting
all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 34\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 9\%
{$\pm$} 2\%, and 3\% {$\pm$} 1\%, respectively. Our completeness analysis
indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% {$\pm$} 2\%) of
solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V {$<$} 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] {$<$}-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4{$\sigma$} significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The
period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio
distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically
indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.},

  abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture
telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg 2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to
Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet
diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean
density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

  abstract = {Young (125 Myr), populous ({$>$}1000 members), and relatively nearby, the Pleiades has provided an anchor for stellar angular momentum models for both younger and older stars. We used K2 to explore the distribution of rotation periods in the Pleiades. With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members, we are vastly expanding the number of Pleiades with periods, particularly at the low-mass end. About 92\% of the members in our sample have at least one measured spot-modulated rotation period. For the {$\sim$}8\% of the members without periods, non-astrophysical
effects often dominate (saturation, etc.), such that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being equal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the Pleiades. The relationship between P and \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 follows the overall trends found in other Pleiades studies. There is a slowly rotating sequence for 1.1 {$\lessequivlnt$}
\{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 {$\lessequivlnt$} 3.7 and a primarily rapidly rotating population for \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 {$\greaterequivlnt$}

continues the discussion, focusing on multiperiod structures, and Paper III speculates about the origin and evolution of the period distribution in the Pleiades.},

  abstract = {We have Fourier-analyzed 941 K2 light curves (LCs) of likely members of Praesepe, measuring periods for 86\% and increasing the number of rotation periods (P) by nearly a factor of four. The distribution of P versus (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}), a mass proxy, has three different regimes: (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {$<$} 1.3, where the rotation rate
rapidly slows as mass decreases; 1.3 {$<$} (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {$<$} 4.5, where the rotation rate slows more gradually as mass decreases; and (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {$>$} 4.5, where the rotation rate rapidly
increases as mass decreases. In this last regime, there is a bimodal distribution of periods, with few between {$\sim$}2 and {$\sim$}10 days. We
interpret this to mean that once M stars start to slow down, they do so rapidly. The K2 period-color distribution in Praesepe ({$\sim$}790 Myr) is much different than that in the Pleiades ({$\sim$}125 Myr) for late F, G, K, and early-M stars; the overall distribution moves to longer periods and is better described by two line segments. For mid-M stars, the relationship has a similarly broad scatter and is steeper in Praesepe. The diversity of LCs and of periodogram types is similar in the two clusters; about a quarter of the periodic stars in both clusters have multiple significant periods. Multi-periodic stars dominate among the higher masses, starting at a bluer color in Praesepe
((V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {$\sim$} 1.5) than in the Pleiades
((V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {$\sim$} 2.6). In Praesepe, there are relatively more LCs that have two widely separated periods, \{\{{$\Delta$} \}\}P{$>$} 6
\{days\}. Some of these could be examples of M star binaries where one star has spun down but the other has not.},

Asteroseismic Inference on a Massive Scale (AIMS) is an open source code that uses Bayesian statistics and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to find a representative set of models that reproduce a given set of classical and asteroseismic constraints. These models are obtained by interpolation on a pre-calculated grid, thereby increasing computational efficiency. We test the accuracy of the different operational modes within AIMS for grids of stellar models computed with the Li\`ege stellar evolution code (main sequence and red giants) and compare the results to those from another asteroseismic analysis pipeline, PARAM. Moreover, using artificial inputs generated from models within the grid (assuming the models to be correct), we focus on the impact on the precision of the code when considering different combinations of observational constraints (individual mode frequencies, period spacings, parallaxes, photospheric constraints,...). Our tests show the absolute limitations of precision on parameter inferences using synthetic data with AIMS, and the consistency of the code with expected parameter uncertainty distributions. Interpolation testing highlights the significance of the underlying physics to the analysis performance of AIMS and provides caution as to the upper limits in parameter step size. All tests demonstrate the flexibility and capability of AIMS as an analysis tool and its potential to perform accurate ensemble analysis with current and future asteroseismic data yields.},

  abstract = {Analyses of data from spectroscopic and astrometric surveys have led to conflicting results concerning the vertical characteristics of the Milky Way. Ages are often used to provide clarity, but typical uncertainties of {$>$} 40 \% from photometry restrict the validity of the inferences made. Using the Kepler APOKASC sample for context, we explore the global population trends of two K2 campaign fields (3 and 6), which extend further vertically out of the Galactic plane than APOKASC. We analyse the properties of red giant stars utilising three asteroseismic data analysis methods to cross-check and validate detections. The Bayesian inference tool PARAM is used to determine the stellar masses, radii and ages. Evidence of a pronounced red giant branch bump and an [{$\alpha$}/Fe] dependence on the position of the red clump is observed from the K2 fields radii distribution. Two peaks in the age distribution centred at {$\sim$}5 and and {$\sim$}12 Gyr are found using a sample with {$\sigma$}age {$<$} 35 \%. In comparison with Kepler, we find the older peak to be more prominent for K2. This age bimodality is also observed based on a chemical selection of low- ({$\leq$} 0.1) and high- ({$>$} 0.1) [{$\alpha$}/Fe] stars. As a function of vertical distance from the Galactic mid-plane (|Z |), the age distribution shows a transition from a young to old stellar population with increasing |Z | for the K2 fields. Further coverage of campaign targets with high resolution spectroscopy is required to increase the yield of precise ages achievable with asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Stellar winds are thought to be the main process responsible for the spin down of main-sequence stars. The extraction of angular momentum by a magnetized wind has been studied for decades, leading to several formulations for the resulting torque. However, previous studies generally consider simple dipole or split monopole stellar magnetic topologies. Here we consider in addition to a dipolar stellar magnetic field, both quadrupolar and octupolar configurations, while also varying the rotation rate and the magnetic field strength. 60 simulations made with a 2.5D, cylindrical and axisymmetric set-up and computed with the PLUTO code were used to find torque formulations for each topology. We further succeed to give a unique law that fits the data for every topology by formulating the torque in terms of the amount of open magnetic flux in the wind. We also show that our formulation can be applied to even more realistic magnetic topologies, with examples of the Sun in its minimum and maximum phase as observed at the Wilcox Solar Observatory, and of a young K-star (TYC-0486- 4943-1) whose topology has been obtained by Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI).},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I\textsubscript{C}{$\approx$}4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 {$\pm$} 13 {$\mu$}as or {$\pm$}6 {$\mu$}as for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 {$\pm$} 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H \textsubscript{0} = 73.24 km s\textsuperscript{-1} Mpc\textsuperscript{-1} used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with {$\Lambda$}CDM at the 2.9{$\sigma$} confidence level (99.6\%). At 96.5\% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8{$\sigma$} (99.99\%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5\% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H \textsubscript{0}.},

Our method takes into account the spectroscopic constraints derived from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, together with the asteroseismic parameters from KASC. These parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsic stellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the Bayesian tool PARAM. We then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observed photometry in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 2MASS, and WISE passbands. The first 1989 giants targetted by APOKASC are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, with individual uncertainties of just{\~ }1.8 per cent. Our extinction estimates are systematically smaller than provided in the Kepler Input Catalogue and by the Schlegel et al. maps. Distances to individual stars in the NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals. Comparison with the APOGEE red clump and SAGA catalogues provide another useful check, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few per cent. Overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinction determinations for the bulk of the APOKASC sample. Approximately one third of the stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions and hence increased uncertainties. Uncertainties are expected to be reduced in future releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will have seismically determined evolutionary status classifications.},

In this work, we implement {$\increment\nu$} and the period spacing, {$\increment$}P, computed along detailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and hence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and 19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available. Adding independent on the stellar luminosity, these values can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent, respectively. The application of these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.},

In particular, colours are needed to derive the interstellar extinction. As no filter is available for the first Gaia data release and to avoid the atmosphere model mismatch, an empirical calibration is unavoidable. The purpose of this work is to provide the first complete and robust photometric empirical calibration of the Gaia Red Clump stars of the solar neighbourhood, through colour-colour, effective temperature-colour and absolute magnitude-colour relations, from the Gaia, Johnson, 2MASS, Hipparcos, Tycho-2, APASS-SLOAN and WISE photometric systems, and the APOGEE DR13 spectroscopic temperatures. We used a 3D extinction map to select low reddening red giants. To calibrate the colour-colour and the effective temperature-colour relations, we developed a MCMC method which accounts for all variable uncertainties and selects the best model for each photometric relation. We estimate the Red Clump absolute magnitude through the mode of a kernel-based distribution function. We provide 20 colour vs G-Ks relations and the first Teff vs G-Ks calibration. We obtained the Red Clump absolute magnitudes for 15 photometric bands with, in particular, M\_Ks = -1.606 +/- 0.009 and M\_G = (0.495 +/- 0.009) + (1.121 +/- 0.128) (G-Ks-2.1).

We compute radii based on the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as by fitting observed oscillation frequencies to stellar models for a subset of the sample, and test the impact of using effective temperatures from either spectroscopy or the infrared flux method. An offset of 3 per cent, showing no dependency on any stellar parameters, is found between seismic parallaxes derived from frequency modelling and those from Gaia. For parallaxes based on radii from the scaling relations, a smaller offset is found on average; however, the offset becomes temperature dependent which we interpret as problems with the scaling relations at high stellar temperatures. Using the hotter infrared flux method temperature scale, there is no indication that radii from the scaling relations are inaccurate by more than about 5 per cent. Taking the radii and masses from the modelling of individual frequencies as reference values, we seek to correct the scaling relations for the observed temperature trend. This analysis indicates that the scaling relations systematically overestimate radii and masses at high temperatures, and that they are accurate to within 5 per cent in radius and 13 per cent in mass for main-sequence stars with temperatures below 6400 K. However, further analysis is required to test the validity of the corrections on a star-by-star basis and for more evolved stars.},

Using radii derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes, we test the accuracy of asteroseismic radii for a sample of 93 dwarfs based on both individual frequency fitting and the seismic scaling relations. Radii from frequency fitting are about 1 per cent smaller than Gaia radii on average; however, this difference may be explained by a negative bias of 30 \$\textbackslash mu\$as in the Gaia parallaxes. This indicates that the radii derived from frequency fitting are accurate to within 1 per cent. The scaling relations are found to overestimate radii by more than 5 per cent, compared to the Gaia radii, at the highest temperatures. We demonstrate that this offset is reduced to 3 per cent after applying corrections based on model frequencies to the scaling relation for \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash nu\$, but only when the model frequencies are corrected for the surface effect. With corrections to \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash nu\$, the scaling relation gives radii accurate to about 2--3 per cent for dwarfs in the temperature range \$5400\$--\$6700\$ K.

Contrary to previous results, we find that the disagreement between the T\textsubscript{eff} scale of red giants and models with solar calibrated mixing length disappears when considering our models and the APOGEE-Kepler stars with scaled solar metal distribution. However, a discrepancy shows up when {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars are included in the sample. We have found that assuming mass, chemical composition and effective temperature scale of the APOGEE-Kepler catalogue, stellar models generally underpredict the change of temperature of red giants caused by {$\alpha$}-element enhancements at fixed [Fe/H]. A second important conclusion is that the choice of the outer boundary conditions employed in model calculations is critical. Effective temperature differences (metallicity dependent) between models with solar calibrated mixing length and observations appear for some choices of the boundary conditions, but this is not a general result.},

The advantage of using M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K}, following recent empirical calibrations of its value for the solar neighbourhood, arises from its very low sensitivity to extinction by interstellar dust. We show that, as in the case of the V- and I-band results, M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K} is a complicated function of the stellar metallicity Z and age t. In general, M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K} is more sensitive to t and Z than M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{I}, for high t and low Z. Moreover, for ages above \textasciitilde 1.5 Gyr, M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K} decreases with increasing Z, i.e. the opposite behaviour with respect to M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{V} and M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{I}. We provide data and equations that allow the determination of the K-band population correction {$\increment$}M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K} (the difference between the red clump brightness in the solar neighbourhood and in the population under scrutiny) for any generic stellar population. These data complement the results presented by Girardi \&amp; Salaris for the V- and I-band. We show how data from galactic open clusters consistently support our predicted {$\increment$}M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{V} , {$\increment$}M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{I} and {$\increment$}M\textsuperscript{RC}\textsubscript{K} values. Multiband VIK population corrections for various galaxy systems are provided. They can be used in conjunction with the method devised by Alves et al., in order to derive simultaneously reddening and distance from the use of VIK observations of red clump stars. We have positively tested this technique on the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc, for which both an empirical parallax-based main-sequence-fitting distance and reddening estimates exist. We have also studied the case of using only V and I photometry, recovering consistent results for both reddening and distance. Application of this method to an OGLE-II field, and the results by Alves et al., confirm a Large Magellanic Cloud distance modulus of about 18.50, in agreement with the Hubble Space Telescope extragalactic distance scale zero-point.},

  abstract = {The activity-related variations in the solar acoustic frequencies have been known for 30 years. However, the importance of the different contributions is still not well established. With this in mind, we developed an empirical model to estimate the spot-induced frequency shifts, which takes into account the sunspot properties, such as area and latitude. The comparison between the model frequency shifts obtained from the daily sunspot records and those observed suggests that the contribution from a stochastic component to the total frequency shifts is about 30\%. The remaining 70\% is related to a global, long-term variation. We also propose a new observable to investigate the short- and mid-term variations of the frequency shifts, which is insensitive to the long-term variations contained in the data. On the shortest time scales the variations in the frequency shifts are strongly correlated with the variations in the total area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is still found, which cannot be fully explained by ignoring the invisible side of the Sun when accounting for the total sunspot area. We also verify that the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot areas do not vary in a similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maximum amplitude of the quasi-biennial variations found in the seismic data.},

  abstract = {Quasi-periodic modulations of the stellar light curve may result from dark spots crossing the visible stellar disc. Due to differential rotation, spots at different latitudes generally have different rotation periods. Hence, by studying spot-induced modulations, one can learn about stellar surface (differential) rotation and magnetic activity. Recently, Reinhold \& Arlt (2015) proposed a method based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of light curves to identify the sign of the differential rotation at the stellar surface. Our goal is to understand how the modulation of the stellar light curve due to the presence of spots and the corresponding periodogram are affected by both the stellar and spot properties. We generate synthetic light curves of stars with different properties (inclination angle, limb darkening, and rotation rate) and spot configurations (number of spots, latitude, intensity contrast, and size). By analysing their Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we compute the ratio between the heights of the second and first harmonics of the rotation period (peak-height-ratio). We find that the peak-height ratios are essentially a function of a single parameter, the fraction of time the spot is visible, which is related to the sinusoidality of the spot modulation. We identify the conditions under which the periodogram analysis can actually provide an estimate of the spot latitudes and/or the stellar inclination angle. We also identify possible sources of error in the identification of the sign of the differential rotation.},

  abstract = {The frequencies of the solar acoustic oscillations vary over the activity cycle. The variations in other activity proxies are found to be well correlated with the variations in the acoustic frequencies. However, each proxy has a slightly different time behaviour. Our goal is to characterize the differences between the time behaviour of the frequency shifts and of two other activity proxies, namely, the area covered by sunspots and the 10.7cm flux. We define a new observable that is particularly sensitive to the short-term frequency variations. We then compare the observable when computed from model frequency shifts and from observed frequency shifts obtained with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) for cycle 23. Our analysis shows that on the shortest time-scales the variations in the frequency shifts seen in the GONG observations are strongly correlated with the variations in the area covered by sunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is still found. We verify that the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot area do not vary in a similar way tend to coincide with the times of the maxima of the quasi-biennial variations seen in the solar seismic data. A similar analysis of the relation between the 10.7cm flux and the frequency shifts reveals that the short-time variations in the frequency shifts follow even more closely those of the 10.7cm flux than those of the sunspot area. However, a loss of correlation between frequency shifts and 10.7cm flux variations is still found around the same times.},

In this work, we analyze the Kepler long-cadence data of 26,521 main-sequence stars of spectral types M and K in order to measure their surface rotation and photometric activity level. Rotation-period estimates are obtained by the combination of a wavelet analysis and autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable rotation estimates are determined by comparing the results from the different rotation diagnostics and four data sets. We also measure the photometric activity proxy \{S\}\textsubscript{ph}\vphantom\{\} using the amplitude of the flux variations on an appropriate timescale. We report rotation periods and photometric activity proxies for about 60\% of the sample, including 4431 targets for which McQuillan et al. did not report a rotation period. For the common targets with rotation estimates in this study and in McQuillan et al., our rotation periods agree within 99\%. In this work, we also identify potential polluters, such as misclassified red giants and classical pulsator candidates. Within the parameter range we study, there is a mild tendency for hotter stars to have shorter rotation periods. The photometric activity proxy spans a wider range of values with increasing effective temperature. The rotation period and photometric activity proxy are also related, with \{S\}\textsubscript{ph}\vphantom\{\} being larger for fast rotators. Similar to McQuillan et al., we find a bimodal distribution of rotation periods.},

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

Unfortunately, the RM effect does not constrain the complement misalignment angle between the orbit of the planet and the spin of its host star along the line of sight (LOS). I use a simple model of stellar rotation benchmarked with observational data to statistically identify 10 exoplanet systems from a sample of 75 for which there is likely a significant degree of spin-orbit misalignment along the LOS: HAT-P-7, HAT-P-14, HAT-P-16, HD 17156, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, TrES-4, WASP-1, WASP-12, and WASP-14. All 10 systems have host stellar masses M \textsubscript{*} in the range 1.2 M \textsubscript{sun} \&lt;\textasciitilde{} M \textsubscript{*} \&lt;\textasciitilde{} 1.5 M \textsubscript{sun}, and the probability of this occurrence by chance is less than one in ten thousand. In addition, the planets in the candidate-misaligned systems are preferentially massive and eccentric. The coupled distribution of misalignment from the RM effect and from this analysis suggests that transiting exoplanets are more likely to be spin-orbit aligned than expected given predictions for a transiting planet population produced entirely by planet-planet scattering or Kozai cycles and tidal friction. For that reason, there are likely two populations of close-in exoplanet systems: a population of aligned systems and a population of apparently misaligned systems in which the processes that lead to misalignment or to the survival of misaligned systems operate more efficiently in systems with massive stars and planets.},

  abstract = {The class of Double Period Variables (DPVs) consists of close interacting binaries, with a characteristic long period that is an order of magnitude longer than the corresponding orbital period, many of them with a characteristic ratio of about 3.5x10\^1. We consider here the possibility that the accretion flow is modulated as a result of a magnetic dynamo cycle. Due to the short binary separations, we expect the rotation of the donor star to be synchronized with the rotation of the binary due to tidal locking. We here present a model to estimate the dynamo number and the resulting relation between the activity cycle length and the orbital period, as well as an estimate for the modulation of the mass transfer rate. The latter is based on Applegate's scenario, implying cyclic changes in the radius of the donor star and thus in the mass transfer rate as a result of magnetic activity. Our model is applied to a sample of 17 systems with known physical parameters, 10 also with known orbital periods. In spite of the uncertainties of our simplified framework, the results show a reasonable agreement, indicating that a dynamo interpretation is potentially feasible. At the same time, we note that the orbital period variations resulting from Applegate's model are sufficiently small to be consistent with the data. We conclude that both larger samples with known physical parameters as well as potential direct probes of the magnetism of the donor star, including cold spots as well as polarization, will be valuable to further constrain the nature of these systems.},

In contrast to other methods, which rely on special sources, our method directly tests the distances to all stars in our sample. We find clear evidence for a near-linear trend of distance bias f with distance s, proving a parallax offset delta p. On average, we find delta p = 0.054 mas (parallaxes in Gaia DR2 need to be increased) when accounting for the parallax uncertainty under-estimate in the Gaia set (delta p = 0.048 mas on the raw parallax errors) with negligible formal error and a systematic uncertainty of about 0.006 mas. The value is in concordance with results from asteroseismic measurements, but differs from the much lower bias found on quasar samples. We further use our method to compile a comprehensive set of quality cuts in colour, apparent magnitude, and astrometric parameters. Last, we find that for this sample delta p appears to strongly depend on the parallax uncertainty sigma\_p (when including the additional 0.043 mas) with a statistical confidence far in excess of 10\textbackslash sigma and a proportionality factor close to 1, though the dependence varies somewhat with sigma\_p. Correcting for the sigma\_p dependence also resolves otherwise unexplained correlations of the offset with the number of observation periods n\_\{vis\} and ecliptic latitude.},

Due to its low and homogeneous interstellar absorption it is considered as a calibration field for Galactic bulge studies. In the era of large spectroscopic surveys, calibration fields such as BW are necessary to cross calibrate the stellar parameters and individual abundances of the APOGEE survey. We use the APOGEE BW stars to derive their metallicity distribution function (MDF) and individual abundances, for \$\textbackslash alpha\$- and iron-peak elements of the APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (DR13), as well as the age distribution for stars in BW. We determine the MDF of APOGEE stars in BW and find a remarkable agreement with that of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES). Both exhibit a clear bimodal distribution. We also find that the Mg-metallicity planes of both surveys agree well, except for the metal-rich part ([Fe/H] {$>$}0.1), where APOGEE finds systematically higher Mg abundances with respect to the GES. The ages based on the [C/N] ratio reveal a bimodal age distribution, with a major old population at 10 Gyr, with a decreasing tail towards younger stars. A comparison between APOGEE estimates and stellar parameters, and those determined by other sources reveals detectable systematic offsets, in particular for spectroscopic surface gravity estimates. In general, we find a good agreement between individual abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni from APOGEE with that of literature values. We have shown that in general APOGEE data show a good agreement in terms of MDF and individual chemical abundances with respect to literature works.

fundamentally linked, making this a challenging task. Of particular interest is the stellar magnetic field geometry. In this work, we consider whether non-dipolar field modes contribute significantly to the spin-down of low-mass stars. We do this using a sample of stars that have all been previously mapped with Zeeman\textendash Doppler imaging. For a given star, as long as its mass-loss rate is below some critical mass-loss rate, only the dipolar fields contribute to its spin-down torque. However, if it has a larger mass-loss rate, higher-order modes need to be considered. For each star, we calculate this critical mass-loss rate, which is a simple function of the field geometry. Additionally, we use two methods of estimating mass-loss rates for our sample of stars. In the majority of cases, we find that the estimated mass-loss rates do not exceed the critical mass-loss rate; hence, the dipolar magnetic field alone is sufficient to determine the spin-down torque. However, we find some evidence that, at large Rossby numbers, non-dipolar modes may start to contribute.},

  abstract = {We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic data for dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5 s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000 days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties. Determinations of surface gravity (\{log\}g), mean density (\&lt; {$\rho$} \&gt; ), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; \{log\}g), 3.4\% (\&lt; {$\rho$} \&gt; ), 2.6\% (R), 5.1\% (M), and 19\% ({$\tau$}) for the photometric \{T\}\textsubscript{\{eff\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\} scale and 2\% (\{log\}g), 3.5\% (\&lt; {$\rho$} \&gt; ), 2.7\% (R), 6.3\% (M), and 23\% ({$\tau$}) for the spectroscopic scale. We present comparisons with stellar quantities in the asteroseismic catalog by Chaplin et al. that highlight the importance of having metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement for all inferred quantities. The latter comparison, in particular, gives strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

  abstract = {Pulsating stars, such as Cepheids, Miras, and RR Lyrae stars, are important distance indicators and calibrators of the "cosmic distance ladder", and yet their period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations are still constrained using simple statistical methods that cannot take full advantage of available data. To enable optimal usage of data provided by the Gaia mission, we present a probabilistic approach that simultaneously constrains parameters of PLZ relations and uncertainties in Gaia parallax measurements. We demonstrate this approach by constraining PLZ relations of RR Lyrae stars in near-infrared W1 and W2 bands, using Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) parallax measurements for a sample of 123 RR Lyrae stars located within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. The fitted PLZ relations are consistent with previous studies, and in combination with other data, deliver distances precise to 6\% (once various sources of uncertainty are taken into account). To a precision of 0.03 mas (\$1\textbackslash sigma\$), we do not find a statistically significant offset in TGAS parallaxes for this sample of distant RR Lyrae stars (median parallax of 0.8 mas and distance of 1.4 kpc). With only minor modifications, our probabilistic approach can be used to constrain PLZ relations of other pulsating stars, and we intend to apply it to Cepheid and Mira stars in the near future.},

  abstract = {There has been much discussion of the tension between the values of Hubble's Constant \$H\_0\$ implied by the distance scale and fits to the microwave background's primordial power spectrum. While the latter is fitted by standard cosmological models with \$H\_0=67.4\textbackslash pm0.5\$kms\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, the distance scale gives \$H\_0=73.45\textbackslash pm1.66\$kms\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$, an \$\textbackslash approx10\$\%, \$\textbackslash approx3.5\textbackslash sigma\$ discrepancy. Here we first show that GAIA parallax distances of Milky Way Cepheids may be between \$\textbackslash approx7-18\$\% larger than previously estimated, with the potential to produce a corresponding reduction in the value of \$H\_0\$. Then we show that the existence of an \$\textbackslash approx150\$h\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc `Local Hole' in the galaxy distribution around our position implies an outflow of \$\textbackslash approx500\$kms\$\^\{-1\}\$ averaging over direction. Accounting for this in the recession velocities of SNIa standard candles out to \$z\textbackslash approx0.1\$ reduces \$H\_0\$ by a further \$\textbackslash approx1.8\$\%, while maintaining reasonable consistency with the supernova Hubble diagram. Combining this result with even an \$\textbackslash approx7\$\% increase in the Cepheid distance scale due to GAIA implies an \$\textbackslash approx9\$\% reduction in the value of the Hubble Constant, decreasing from \$H\_0\textbackslash approx73.45\$ to 67.6 kms\$\^\{-1\}\$Mpc\$\^\{-1\}\$. This would leave the distance scale and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background values entirely consistent, thus potentially relieving the previous \$H\_0\$ tension.},

  abstract = {With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modeling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the number of low-mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the \{\{{$\increment$} \}\}{$\nu$} scaling relation suggested by stellar models significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to \{\{{$\increment$} \}\}{$\nu$} also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with \{\{[Fe/H]\}\}\textbackslash lt -0.5 and \{\{[Fe/H]\}\}\textbackslash gt 0 or for \{T\}\textsubscript{\{\{eff\vphantom{\}\}}}\vphantom\{\}\vphantom\{\}\textbackslash gt 4700 K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike Galaxia, it had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.},

found to have an equally split frequency septuplet, though its
oscillation seems to be essentially an axisymmetric dipole mode with
respect to the magnetic axis, which is oblique to the rotation axis
(Kurtz 1992, Kurtz et al. 1993). In order to explain this fine
structure, we consider the magnetic stars by taking account of the
perturbations due to the magnetic fields and the rotation. We show that
the effect of the magnetic field on the axisymmetric dipole modes
distorts the dipole oscillation pattern to have axisymmetric octupole
components, so that the frequency pattern becomes a septuplet rather
than a triplet, and that the additional effect of the rotation causes
the frequency pattern to be asymmetric. The formula allow us to obtain
information concerning the magnetic fields, rotation, and geometrical
configuration of the star from the oscillation data.},

asteroseismology has been thought to be particularly successful in such
an endeavor for stars in different evolutionary stages. However, to
fully exploit its potential, robust methods for estimating stellar
parameters are required and independent verification of the results is
mandatory. With this purpose, we present a new technique to obtain
stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis with the InfraRed
Flux Method. By using two global seismic observables and multi-band
photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii, effective
temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field stars in
a self-consistent manner. We apply our method to 22 solar-like
oscillators in the Kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate
Hipparcos parallaxes. Our distance determinations agree to better than
5\%, while measurements of spectroscopic effective temperatures and
interferometric radii also validate our results. We briefly discuss the
potential of our technique for stellar population analysis and models of

In a slightly less massive target the presence of a convective core cannot be conclusively discarded, and thus its remaining main-sequence lifetime is uncertain. Our results reveal that best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies of oscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproduce frequency combinations. Moreover, slightly different criteria to define what the best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties but very different interior structures. We argue that the use of frequency ratios is a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that our analysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5\%, 4\%, and 10\% in radius, mass, and age, respectively. We compare our results with those obtained from global oscillation properties, and discuss the possible sources of uncertainties in asteroseismic stellar modeling where further studies are still needed.},

We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement.

Here we demonstrate its potential for investigating the Galaxy by carrying out the first asteroseismic ensemble study of red giant stars observed by TESS. We use a sample of 25 stars for which we measure their global asteroseimic observables and estimate their fundamental stellar properties, such as radius, mass, and age. Significant improvements are seen in the uncertainties of our estimates when combining seismic observables from TESS with astrometric measurements from the Gaia mission compared to when the seismology and astrometry are applied separately. Specifically, when combined we show that stellar radii can be determined to a precision of a few percent, masses to 5-10\% and ages to the 20\% level. This is comparable to the precision typically obtained using end-of-mission Kepler data.},

We use Gaia parallaxes to distinguish photometric binaries (PBs; from single stars on the unevolved lower main sequence, and compare their distribution of rotation properties to those of single stars both with and without Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectroscopic characterization. We find that 59\% of stars with 1.5 day \&lt; P \&lt; 7 day lie 0.3 mag above the main sequence, compared with 28\% of the full rotation sample. The fraction of stars in the same period range is 1.7 {$\pm$} 0.1\% of the total sample analyzed for rotation periods. Both the PB fraction and the fraction of rapid rotators are consistent with a population of non-eclipsing short-period binaries inferred from Kepler eclipsing binary data after correcting for inclination. This suggests that the rapid rotators are dominated by tidally synchronized binaries rather than single stars obeying traditional angular momentum evolution.

  abstract = {We use 5,337 spectroscopic \$v \textbackslash sin i\$ measurements of Kepler dwarfs and subgiants from the APOGEE survey to study stellar rotation trends. We find a detection threshold of 10 km/s, which allows us to explore the spindown of intermediate-mass stars leaving the main sequence, merger products, young stars, and tidally-synchronized binaries. We see a clear distinction between blue stragglers and the field turnoff in \$\textbackslash alpha\$-rich stars, with a sharp rapid rotation cutoff for blue stragglers consistent with the Kraft break. We also find rapid rotation and RV variability in a sample of red straggler stars, considerably cooler than the giant branch, lending credence to the hypothesis that these are active, tidally-synchronized binaries. We see clear evidence for a transition between rapid and slow rotation on the subgiant branch in the domain predicted by modern angular momentum evolution models. We find substantial agreement between the spectroscopic and photometric properties of KIC targets added by Huber et al (2014) based on 2MASS photometry. For the unevolved lower main sequence, we see the same concentration toward rapid rotation in photometric binaries as that observed in rotation period data, but at an enhanced rate. We attribute this difference to unresolved near-equal luminosity spectroscopic binaries with velocity displacements on the order of the APOGEE resolution. Among cool unevolved stars we find an excess rapid rotator fraction of 4\% caused by pipeline issues with photometric binaries.},

Here we characterize these differences by systematically comparing some of the commonly adopted ingredients; line lists, equivalent width measurements and atomic parameters. High resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data of one helium-core-burning red giant star in each of the three open clusters, NGC6819, M67 and NGC188 have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The M67 target has been used to benchmark the analysis, as it is a well studied cluster with asteroseismic data from the K2 mission. For the other two clusters we have obtained higher quality data than previously analyzed, which allows us to establish their chemical composition more securely. Using a line by line analysis, we tested several different combinations of line lists and programs to measure equivalent widths of absorption lines to characterize systematic differences within the same spectroscopic method. The obtained parameters for the benchmark star in M67 vary up to \textasciitilde 170 K in T\_eff, \textasciitilde 0.4 dex in log g and \textasciitilde 0.25 dex in [Fe/H] between the tested setups. Using the combination of equivalent width measurement program and line list that best reproduce the inferred log g from asteroseismology, we determined the atmospheric parameters for the three stars and securely established the chemical composition of NGC6819 to be \textasciitilde solar, [Fe/H]=-0.02+-0.01 dex. We have highlighted the significantly different results obtained with different combinations of line lists, programs and atomic parameters, which emphasize the importance of benchmark stars studied with several different methods to anchor spectroscopic analyses.},

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

High-precision HST observations of several super-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K have to date all resulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be due to high-altitude clouds. We report the detection of an atmospheric feature in the atmosphere of a 1.6 Mearth transiting exoplanet, GJ 1132b, with an equilibrium temperature of \textasciitilde 600 K and orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We present observations of nine transits of the planet obtained simultaneously in the griz and JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.44 +/- 0.21 Rearth for the planet, averaged over all the passbands, which can be decomposed into a "surface radius" at \textasciitilde 1.35 Rearth, and higher contributions in the z and K bands. The z-band radius is 4 sigma higher than the continuum, suggesting a strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the reliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the existence of repeat observations. The large z-band transit depth indicates strong opacity from H2O and/or CH4 or an hitherto unconsidered opacity. A surface radius of 1.35 +/- 0.21 Rearth allows for a wide range of interior compositions ranging from a nearly Earth-like rocky interior, with \textasciitilde 70\% silicate and \textasciitilde 30\% Fe, to a substantially H2O-rich water world. New observations with HST and existing ground-based facilities would be able to confirm the present detection and further constrain the atmospheric composition of the planet.},

We demonstrate the method using 675 Kepler stars for which these measures are available in the literature, and show that the stellar masses can be measured with this method to a precision of \$\textbackslash sim\$25\%, limited by the surface-gravity precision of the granulation "flicker" method (\$\textbackslash sim\$0.1 dex) and by the parallax uncertainties (\$\textbackslash sim\$10\% for the Kepler sample). We explore the impact of expected improvements in the surface gravity determinations---through the application of granulation background fitting and the use of recently published granulation-metallicity relations---and improvements in the parallaxes with the arrival of the Gaia second data release. We show that the application of this methodology to stars that will be observed by TESS should yield radii good to a few percent and masses good to \$\textbackslash approx\$10\%. Importantly, the method does not require the presence of an orbiting, eclipsing, or transiting body, nor does it require spatial resolution of the stellar surface. Thus we can anticipate the determination of fundamental, accurate stellar radii and masses for millions of bright single stars---across the entire sky and spanning the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram---including those that will ultimately be found to host planets.},

We report on the recent asteroFLAG hare-and-hounds Exercise\#2, where a group of `hares' simulated data of F-K main-sequence stars that a group of `hounds' sought to analyze, aimed at determining the stellar radii. Based on the asteroseismic large frequency spacing, obtained from simulations of 4-year time series data from the Kepler mission, we demonstrate that the stellar radii can be correctly and precisely determined, when combined with traditional stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalogue. The radii found by the various methods used by each independent hound generally agree with the true values of the artificial stars to within 3\%, when the large frequency spacing is used. This is 5--10 times better than the results where seismology is not applied. These results give strong confidence that radius estimation can be performed to better than 3\% for solar-like stars using automatic pipeline reduction.

Techniques for determining cluster membership therefore play a key role in the investigation of clusters.

Four previously identified seismic non-members in NGC6819 are confirmed in this study, and three additional non-members are found -- two in NGC6819 and one in NGC6791.

One science goal that makes optimal use of K2's capabilities, in particular its 360\textdegree{} ecliptic field of view, is galactic archaeology\textemdash the study of the evolution of the Galaxy from the fossil stellar record. The thrust of this research is to exploit high-precision, time-resolved photometry from K2 in order to detect oscillations in red giant stars. This asteroseismic information can provide estimates of stellar radius (hence distance), mass, and age of vast numbers of stars across the Galaxy. Here we present the initial analysis of a subset of red giants, observed toward the north galactic gap, during the mission's first full science campaign. We investigate the feasibility of using K2 data for detecting oscillations in red giants that span a range in apparent magnitude and evolutionary state (hence intrinsic luminosity). We demonstrate that oscillations are detectable for essentially all cool giants within the \{log\}g range{\~ }1.9-3.2. Our detection is complete down to \{\textbackslash text\{Kp\}\}{\~ } 14.5, which results in a seismic sample with little or no detection bias.

  abstract = {Observations of stellar clusters have had a tremendous impact in forming our understanding of stellar evolution. The open cluster M67 has a particularly important role as a calibration benchmark for stellar evolution theory due to its near-solar composition and age. As a result, it has been observed extensively, including attempts to detect solar-like oscillations in its main sequence and red giant stars. However, any asteroseismic inference has so far remained elusive due to the difficulty in measuring these extremely low-amplitude oscillations. Here we report the first unambiguous detection of solar-like oscillations in the red giants of M67. We use data from the Kepler ecliptic mission, K2, to measure the global asteroseismic properties. We find a model-independent seismic-informed distance of 816 {$\pm$} 11 pc, or \{(m-M)\}\textsubscript{0} = 9.57+/- 0.03 mag, an average red giant mass of 1.36+/- 0.01 \{M\}\textsubscript{{$\Sun$} }, in agreement with the dynamical mass from an eclipsing binary near the cluster turn-off, and ages of individual stars compatible with isochrone fitting. We see no evidence of strong mass loss on the red giant branch. We also determine seismic \{log\}g of all the cluster giants with a typical precision of{\~ } 0.01 dex. Our results generally show good agreement with independent methods and support the use of seismic scaling relations to determine global properties of red giant stars with near-solar metallicity. We further illustrate that the data are of such high quality that future work on individual mode frequencies should be possible, which would extend the scope of seismic analysis of this cluster.},

Its first campaign covered a field near the north galactic cap, a region never covered before by large asteroseismic-ensemble investigations, and was therefore of particular interest for exploring this part of our Galaxy. Here we report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission's "North Galactic Cap" campaign 1. Our consolidated analysis uses six independent methods to measure the global seismic properties, in particular the large frequency separation, and the frequency of maximum power. From the full target sample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red giants, a number comparable with estimates from galactic synthesis modeling. Thus, as a valuable by-product we find roughly 7500 stars to be dwarfs, which provide a sample well suited for galactic exoplanet occurrence studies because they originate from our simple and easily reproducible selection function. In addition, to facilitate the full potential of the data set for galactic archaeology we assess the detection completeness of our sample of oscillating red giants. We find the sample is at least near complete for stars with 40 {$<$} numax/microHz {$<$} 270, and numax\_detec {$<$} 2.6*1e6 * 2e-Kp microHz. There is a detection bias against helium core burning stars with numax \textasciitilde{} 30 microHz, affecting the number of measurements of DeltaNu and possibly also numax. Although we can detect oscillations down to Kp = 15, our campaign 1 sample lacks enough faint giants to assess the detection completeness for stars fainter than Kp \textasciitilde{} 14.5.},

However, robust constraints on stellar ages are currently available for only a limited number of stars. The all-sky survey TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) will observe the brightest stars in the sky and thus can be used to investigate the age distributions of stars in these components of the Galaxy via asteroseismology, where previously this has been difficult using other techniques. The aim of this preliminary study was to determine whether TESS will be able to provide evidence for quenching periods during the star formation history of the Milky Way. Using a population synthesis code, we produced populations based on various stellar formation history models and limited the analysis to red-giant-branch stars. We investigated the mass-Galactic-disk-height distributions, where stellar mass was used as an age proxy, to test for whether periods of quenching can be observed by TESS. We found that even with the addition of 15\% noise to the inferred masses, it will be possible for TESS to find evidence for/against quenching periods suggested in the literature (e.g. between 7 and 9 Gyr ago), therefore providing stringent constraints on the formation and evolution of the Milky Way.},

develop two methods that use the frequency shifts to infer minimum and
maximum latitudes for the active bands. Our methods respond to the range
in latitude over which there is significant magnetic flux present, over

to draw accurate inferences in the solar case, using Sun-as-a-star

  abstract = {Core helium-burning red clump (RC) stars are excellent standard candles in the Milky Way. These stars may have more precise distance estimates from spectrophotometry than from Gaia parallaxes beyond 3 kpc. However, RC stars have values of T \textsubscript{eff} and \{log\}g that are very similar to some red giant branch (RGB) stars. Especially for low-resolution spectroscopic studies where T \textsubscript{eff}, \{log\}g, and [Fe/H] can only be estimated with limited precision, separating RC stars from RGB through established methods can incur{\~ }20\% contamination. Recently, Hawkins et al. demonstrated that the additional information in single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly differentiate RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we establish a data-driven mapping from spectral flux space to independently determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period spacing. From this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and APOGEE DR14 data, with{\~ }9\% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92249 stars with a contamination of only{\~ }3\%, by restricting the combined analysis to LAMOST stars with S/N\textsubscript{pix} {$\geq$} 75. This demonstrates that high-signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can identify RC samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming and ongoing surveys such as TESS, DESI, and LAMOST will continue to improve the overlapping training spectroscopic-asteroseismic sample, the method presented in this study provides an efficient and straightforward way to derive a vast yet pristine sample of RC stars to reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Milky Way.},

determine the precision of parameters in fitting Lorentzian profiles to
helioseismic power spectra. The precision of frequency, linewidth,
amplitude and noise determination for a single p mode, and of the l = 1
splitting, are derived as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio and
the spectral resolution of the spectrum, Libbrecht's formula (Libbrecht
1992) for frequency precision is derived in a more general case. For
validating the approach, the theoretical precisions are compared with
those obtained with Monte-Carlo simulations and with IPHIR observations.
The robustness of the precisions obtained is ideal for predictive
purposes. The method used to derive the precisions is general enough so
that it can be used for other purposes.},

  abstract = {We analyse the effect on adiabatic stellar oscillation frequencies of replacing the near-surface layers in 1D stellar structure models with averaged 3D stellar surface convection simulations. The main difference is an expansion of the atmosphere by 3D convection, expected to explain a major part of the asteroseismic surface effect; a systematic overestimation of p-mode frequencies due to inadequate surface physics. We employ pairs of 1D stellar envelope models and 3D simulations from a previous calibration of the mixing-length parameter, alpha. That calibration constitutes the hitherto most consistent matching of 1D models to 3D simulations, ensuring that their differences are not spurious, but entirely due to the 3D nature of convection. The resulting frequency shift is identified as the structural part of the surface effect. The important, typically non-adiabatic, modal components of the surface effect are not included in the present analysis, but relegated to future papers. Evaluating the structural surface effect at the frequency of maximum mode amplitude, \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\$, we find shifts from \$\textbackslash delta\textbackslash nu\$=-0.8 microHz for giants at \$\textbackslash log g\$=2.2 to -35 microHz for a (\$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=6901\$ K, \$\textbackslash log g\$=4.29) dwarf. The fractional effect \$\textbackslash delta\textbackslash nu(\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash rm max\})/\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}\$, ranges from -0.1\% for a cool dwarf (4185 K, 4.74) to -6\% for a warm giant (4962 K, 2.20).},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope has provided time series of red giants of such unprecedented quality that a detailed asteroseismic analysis becomes possible. For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously Corsaro et al. 2015, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications We aim to extend the sample of red giants for which internal rotation ratios obtained by theoretical modeling of peak-bagged frequencies are available. We also derive the rotation ratios using different methods, and compare the results of these methods with each other. We built seismic models using a grid search combined with a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm and obtained rotation averages employing Bayesian inference and inversion methods. We compared these averages with those obtained using a previously developed model-independent method. We find that the cores of the red giants in this sample are rotating 5 to 10 times faster than their envelopes, which is consistent with earlier results. The rotation rates computed from the different methods show good agreement for some targets, while some discrepancies exist for others.},

This has led to detailed study of the biases induced by the instruments that measure intensity or Doppler velocity variation. Photospheric turbulence hardly influences the tiny signature of conditions in the energy-generating core in the low-order modes, which are therefore very informative. We use sound-speed and density profiles inferred from GOLF and MDI data including these modes, together with recent improvements to stellar model computations, to build a spherically symmetric seismically adjusted model in agreement with the observations. The model is in hydrostatic and thermal balance and produces the present observed luminosity. In constructing the model, we adopt the best physics available, although we adjust some fundamental ingredients, well within the commonly estimated errors, such as the p-p reaction rate (+1\%) and the heavy-element abundance (+3.5\%); we also examine the sensitivity of the density profile to the nuclear reaction rates. Then, we deduce the corresponding emitted neutrino fluxes and consequently demonstrate that it is unlikely that the deficit of the neutrino fluxes measured on Earth can be explained by a spherically symmetric classical model without neutrino flavor transitions. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our results and future developments.},

It presents results based on an original strategy that looks for multiplets instead of single peaks, taking into consideration our knowledge of the solar interior from acoustic modes. Five years of quasi-continuous measurements collected with the helioseismic GOLF experiment aboard the SOHO spacecraft are analyzed. We use different power spectrum estimators and calculate confidence levels for the most significant peaks. This approach allows us to look for signals with velocities down to 2 mm s-1, not far from the limit of existing instruments aboard SOHO, amplitudes that have never been investigated up to now. We apply the method to series of 1290 days, beginning in 1996 April, near the solar cycle minimum. An automatic detection algorithm lists those peaks and multiplets that have a probability of more than 90\% of not being pure noise. The detected patterns are then followed in time, considering also series of 1768 and 2034 days, partly covering the solar cycle maximum. In the analyzed frequency range, the probability of detection of the multiplets does not increase with time as for very long lifetime modes. This is partly due to the observational conditions after 1998 October and the degradation of these observational conditions near the solar maximum, since these modes have a ``mixed'' character and probably behave as acoustic modes. Several structures retain our attention because of the presence of persistent peaks along the whole time span. These features may support the idea of an increase of the rotation in the inner core. There are good arguments for thinking that complementary observations up to the solar activity minimum in 2007 will be decisive for drawing conclusions on the presence or absence of gravity modes detected aboard the SOHO satellite.},

High-quality parallaxes ({$\sigma$}\textsubscript{{$\pi$}}/{$\pi\&$}lt;10\%) and photometry of these very bright stars come from Hipparcos measurements.

What is more important, the range of metallicity of the Hipparcos sample partially overlaps with metallicity of field giants in the LMC, thus making it possible to determine the distance to the LMC by almost direct comparison of brightness of the local Hipparcos red clump giants with that of LMC stars. Photometry of field red clump giants in nine low-extinction fields of the LMC halo collected during the OGLE II microlensing survey compared with the Hipparcos red clump stars data yields the distance modulus to the LMC: (m-M)\textsubscript{LMC}=18.24+/-0.08 mag.

to ultrastable pointing enabled by use of four reaction wheels. The loss
of two of these reaction wheels reduced the telescope's ability to point
precisely for extended periods of time, and as a result, the photometric
precision has suffered. We present a technique for generating
photometric light curves from pixel-level data obtained with the
two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2. Our photometric technique
accounts for the nonuniform pixel response function of the Kepler
detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's
pointing and removing the dependence. When we apply our technique to the
ensemble of stars observed during the Kepler Two-Wheel Concept
Engineering Test, we find improvements over raw K2 photometry by factors
of 2-5, with noise properties qualitatively similar to Kepler targets at
the same magnitudes. We find evidence that the improvement in
photometric precision depends on each target's position in the Kepler
field of view, with worst precision near the edges of the field.
Overall, this technique restores the median-attainable photometric
precision within a factor of two of the original Kepler photometric
precision for targets ranging from 10th to 15th magnitude in the Kepler
bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35\% to that of Kepler
for stars between 12th and 13th magnitude in the Kepler bandpass.},

signals in time-domain data. In addition to advantages of the
Lomb-Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the
superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST's bright RR Lyrae stars
with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.},

a study of the depth of about 500 transit events of the Hot Jupiter

We find a systematic variation in the depth of the primary transit,
related to quarters of data and recurring yearly. These seasonal
variations are about 1\%. Within seasons, we find no evidence for trends.
We speculate that the cause of the seasonal variations could be unknown
field crowding or instrumental artifacts. Our results show that care
must be taken when combining transits throughout different quarters of
Kepler data. Measuring the relative planetary radius of HAT-P-7b without
taking these systematic effects into account leads to unrealistically
low error estimates. This effect could be present in all Kepler targets.
If so, relative radius measurements of all Hot Jupiters to a precision
much better than 1\% are unrealistic.},

Via asteroseismology we determine the following stellar and planetary parameters with high precision; M\$\_\textbackslash star = 1.214 \textbackslash pm 0.033\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, R\$\_\textbackslash star = 1.352 \textbackslash pm 0.010\$ R\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, Age = \$2.76 \textbackslash pm 0.54\$ Gyr, planetary radius (\$2.838 \textbackslash pm 0.054\$ R\$\_\textbackslash oplus\$), and orbital eccentricity (\$0.17\^\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\}\$). In addition, rotational splitting of the pulsation modes allows for a measurement of Kepler-410A's inclination and rotation rate. Our measurement of an inclination of \$82.5\^\{+7.5\}\_\{-2.5\}\$ [\$\^\textbackslash circ\$] indicates a low obliquity in this system. Transit timing variations indicate the presence of at least one additional (non-transiting) planet in the system.},

The validation of Kepler-410 (KOI-42) was complicated due to the presence of a companion star, and the planetary nature of the system was confirmed after analyzing a Spitzer transit observation as well as ground-based follow-up observations.},

  abstract = {Solar system planets move on almost circular orbits. In strong contrast, many massive gas giant exoplanets travel on highly elliptical orbits, whereas the shape of the orbits of smaller, more terrestrial, exoplanets remained largely elusive. Knowing the eccentricity distribution in systems of small planets would be important as it holds information about the planet's formation and evolution, and influences its habitability. We make these measurements using photometry from the Kepler satellite and utilizing a method relying on Kepler's second law, which relates the duration of a planetary transit to its orbital eccentricity, if the stellar density is known. Our sample consists of 28 bright stars with precise asteroseismic density measurements. These stars host 74 planets with an average radius of 2.6 \$R\_\textbackslash oplus\$. We find that the eccentricity of planets in Kepler multi-planet systems is low and can be described by a Rayleigh distribution with \$\textbackslash sigma\$ = 0.049 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.013. This is in full agreement with solar system eccentricities, but in contrast to the eccentricity distributions previously derived for exoplanets from radial velocity studies. Our findings are helpful in identifying which planets are habitable because the location of the habitable zone depends on eccentricity, and to determine occurrence rates inferred for these planets because planets on circular orbits are less likely to transit. For measuring eccentricity it is crucial to detect and remove Transit Timing Variations (TTVs), and we present some previously unreported TTVs. Finally transit durations help distinguish between false positives and true planets and we use our measurements to confirm six new exoplanets.},

  abstract = {The selection and identification of a suitable hydrological model structure is more than fitting parameters of a model structure to reproduce a measured hydrograph. The procedure is highly dependent on various criteria, i.e. the modelling objective, the characteristics and the scale of the system under investigation as well as the available data. Rigorous analysis of the candidate model structures is needed to support and objectify the selection of the most appropriate structure for a specific case (or eventually justify the use of a proposed ensemble of structures). This holds both in the situation of choosing between a limited set of different structures as well as in the framework of flexible model structures with interchangeable components. Many different methods to evaluate and analyse model structures exist. This leads to a sprawl of available methods, all characterized by different assumptions, changing conditions of application and various code implementations. Methods typically focus on optimization, sensitivity analysis or uncertainty analysis, with backgrounds from optimization, machine-learning or statistics amongst others. These methods also need an evaluation metric (objective function) to compare the model outcome with some observed data. However, for current methods described in literature, implementations are not always transparent and reproducible (if available at all). No standard procedures exist to share code and the popularity (and amount of applications) of the methods is sometimes more dependent on the availability than the merits of the method. Moreover, new implementations of existing methods are difficult to verify and the different theoretical backgrounds make it difficult for environmental scientists to decide about the usefulness of a specific method. A common and open framework with a large set of methods can support users in deciding about the most appropriate method. Hence, it enables to simultaneously apply and compare different methods on a fair basis. We developed and present pySTAN (python framework for STructure Analysis), a python package containing a set of functions for model structure evaluation to provide the analysis of (hydrological) model structures. A selected set of algorithms for optimization, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is currently available, together with a set of evaluation (objective) functions and input distributions to sample from. The methods are implemented model-independent and the python language provides the wrapper functions to apply administer external model codes. Different objective functions can be considered simultaneously with both statistical metrics and more hydrology specific metrics. By using so-called reStructuredText (sphinx documentation generator) and Python documentation strings (docstrings), the generation of manual pages is semi-automated and a specific environment is available to enhance both the readability and transparency of the code. It thereby enables a larger group of users to apply and compare these methods and to extend the functionalities.},

Aims: The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained. \\
Methods: The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained. \\
Results: The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. \\
Conclusions: The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

The calculation makes use of the shearing sheet model and is carried out for a range of cooling times. Although the solutions to the inviscid problem with no cooling or diffusion are well known, it is non-trivial to predict the effect caused by the introduction of cooling and of small diffusivities; this work focuses on perturbations of intermediate wavelengths, therefore representing an extension to the classical stability analysis on thermal and viscous instabilities. For density wave modes the analysis can be simplified by means of a regular perturbation analysis; considering both shear and thermal diffusivities, the system is found to be overstable for intermediate and long wavelengths for values of the Toomre parameter \$Q \textbackslash lesssim 2\$; a non-SG instability is also detected for wavelengths \$\textbackslash gtrsim 18H\$, where \$H\$ is the disc scale height, as long as \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash lesssim 1.305\$. The regular perturbation analysis does not however hold for the entropy and potential vorticity slow modes as their ideal growth rates are degenerate. To understand their evolution, equations for the axisymmetric structure's amplitudes in these two quantities are analytically derived and their instability regions obtained. The instability appears boosted by increasing the value of the adiabatic index and of the Prandtl number, while it is quenched by efficient cooling.},

As they become older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed slowdown in surface rotation. The technique of `gyrochronology' uses the rotation period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age must be used for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested for old stars (older than 1\,gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for stars in an open cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5\,Gyr old), and for old field stars whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data for the cluster agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations fail to describe the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary modelling, and confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars that are more evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate dramatically weakened magnetic braking for old stars can\textemdash unlike existing models\textemdash reproduce both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings might suggest a fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos, with the Sun being close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized winds. This weakened braking limits the diagnostic power of gyrochronology for those stars that are more than halfway through their main-sequence lifetimes.},

In this article, we address the challenge of interpreting such data sets with a forward-modeling exercise. We combine theoretical models of stellar rotation, a stellar population model for the galaxy, and prescriptions for observational bias to predict the rotation distribution in the Kepler field under standard ``vanilla'' assumptions. We arrive at two central conclusions: first, that standard braking models fail to reproduce the observed distribution at long periods, and second, that the interpretation of the period distribution is complicated by a mixture of evolutionary states and observational uncertainties. If we assume that the detectability of rotational signatures scales with the Rossby number, we can show that the observed period distribution contains an apparent ``Rossby edge'' at \{\{\{Ro\}\}\}\textsubscript{thresh}\vphantom\{\}=2.08, above which long-period, high Rossby number stars are either absent or undetected. This threshold suggests either that weakened magnetic braking is in operation in the full Kepler population or that stars undergo a transition in spottedness and activity. We discuss the observations necessary to disentangle these competing scenarios. Regardless of the physical origin of the edge, it biases the inferred age distributions, affecting stars older than {$\sim$}9 Gyr at \{T\}\textsubscript{eff}\vphantom\{\}=5100 \{\{K\}\}, older than {$\sim$} 4.2 \{Gyr\} at solar temperatures, and 1.5 \{Gyr\} at 6500 K.

  abstract = {Stellar rotation is a strong function of both mass and evolutionary state. Missions such as Kepler and CoRoT provide tens of thousands of rotation periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations (\textasciitilde 0.4-2.0 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}). We find that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence (MS) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the MS with high rotation rates. Intermediate rotators (10-40 days) can be either cool MS dwarfs, suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses. Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There exists a period-age relation for subgiants distinct from the MS period-age relations. There is also a period-radius relation that can be used as a constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on the MS persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.},

  abstract = {We present the asteroseismic analysis of 1948 F-, G- and K-type main-sequence and subgiant stars observed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Kepler mission. We detect and characterize solar-like oscillations in 642 of these stars. This represents the largest cohort of main-sequence and subgiant solar-like oscillators observed to date. The photometric observations are analysed using the methods developed by nine independent research teams. The results are combined to validate the determined global asteroseismic parameters and calculate the relative precision by which the parameters can be obtained. We correlate the relative number of detected solar-like oscillators with stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalogue and find a deficiency for stars with effective temperatures in the range 5300 {$\lessequivlnt$}T\textsubscript{eff}{$\lessequivlnt$} 5700 K and a drop-off in detected oscillations in stars approaching the red edge of the classical instability strip. We compare the power-law relationships between the frequency of peak power, {$\nu$}\textsubscript{max}, the mean large frequency separation, {$\increment\nu$}, and the maximum mode amplitude, A\textsubscript{max}, and show that there are significant method-dependent differences in the results obtained. This illustrates the need for multiple complementary analysis methods to be used to assess the robustness and reproducibility of results derived from global asteroseismic parameters.},

ignored. The remaining deviation is more difficult to address. We find that the influence of the scaling relation errors on asteroseismically derived values of \{log\}g are well within uncertainties. The influence of the errors on mass and radius estimates is small for main sequence and subgiants, but can be quite large for red giants.},

The values of the global seismic parameters, {$\nu$} \textsubscript{max} (the frequency where the smoothed amplitude of the oscillations peak) and {$\increment\nu$} (the large frequency separation), are frequently used in grid-based modeling searches. However, the methods by which {$\increment\nu$} is calculated from observed data and how {$\increment\nu$} is calculated from stellar models are not the same. Typically for observed stars, especially for those with low signal-to-noise data, {$\increment\nu$} is calculated by taking the power spectrum of a power spectrum, or with autocorrelation techniques. However, for stellar models, the actual individual mode frequencies are calculated and the average spacing between them directly determined. In this work we try to determine the best way to combine model frequencies in order to obtain {$\increment\nu$} that can be compared with observations. For this we use stars with high signal-to-noise observations from Kepler as well as simulated Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data of Ball et al. We find that when determining {$\increment\nu$} from individual mode frequencies the best method is to use the {$\mathscr{l}$} = 0 modes with either no weighting or with a Gaussian weighting around {$\nu$} \textsubscript{max}.},

  abstract = {Context. The space missions CoRoT and Kepler have provided photometric data of unprecedented quality for asteroseismology. A very rich oscillation pattern has been discovered for red giants, including mixed modes that are used to decipher the red giants' interiors. They carry information on the radiative core of red giant stars and bring strong constraints on stellar evolution. \\
 Aims: Since more than 15 000 red giant light curves have been observed by Kepler, we have developed a simple and efficient method for automatically characterizing the mixed-mode pattern and measuring the asymptotic period spacing. \\
 Methods: With the asymptotic expansion of the mixed modes, we have revealed the regularity of the gravity-mode pattern. The stretched periods were used to study the evenly space periods with a Fourier analysis and to measure the gravity period spacing, even when rotation severely complicates the oscillation spectra. \\
 Results: We automatically measured gravity period spacing for more than 6100 Kepler red giants. The results confirm and extend previous measurements made by semi-automated methods. We also unveil the mass and metallicity dependence of the relation between the frequency spacings and the period spacings for stars on the red giant branch. \\
 Conclusions: The delivery of thousands of period spacings combined with all other seismic and non-seismic information provides a new basis for detailed ensemble asteroseismology.

With the unprecedented precision and nearly continuous photometric data acquired by the NASA Kepler mission, parameters of more than 10\textsuperscript{4} stars have been determined nearly consistently. However, most studies still use photometric effective temperatures (T \textsubscript{eff}) and metallicities ([Fe/H]) as inputs, which are not sufficiently accurate as suggested by previous studies. We adopted the spectroscopic T \textsubscript{eff} and [Fe/H] values based on the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) low-resolution spectra (R {$\simeq$} 1800), and combined them with the global oscillation parameters to derive the physical parameters of a large sample of stars. Clear trends were found between \{\{{$\increment$} \}\}\{log\}g(\{\{LAMOST\}\}-\{\{seismic\}\}) and spectroscopic T \textsubscript{eff} as well as log g, which may result in an overestimation of up to 0.5 dex for the log g values of giants in the LAMOST catalog. We established empirical calibration relations for the log g values of dwarfs and giants. These results can be used for determining the precise distances to these stars based on their spectroscopic parameters.},

  abstract = {v0.9.0 (July 2018) Note: a version of these release notes with working links appears in the online documentation. This is a major release with several substantial and long-desired new features. There are also updates/modifications to the themes and color palettes that give better consistency with matplotlib 2.0 and some notable API changes. New relational plots Three completely new plotting functions have been added: catplot, scatterplot, and lineplot. The first is a figure-level interface to the latter two that combines them with a FacetGrid. The functions bring the high-level, dataset-oriented API of the seaborn categorical plotting functions to more general plots (scatter plots and line plots). These functions can visualize a relationship between two numeric variables while mapping up to three additional variables by modifying hue, size, and/or style semantics. The common high-level API is implemented differently in the two functions. For example, the size semantic in scatterplot scales the area of scatter plot points, but in lineplot it scales width of the line plot lines. The API is dataset-oriented, meaning that in both cases you pass the variable in your dataset rather than directly specifying the matplotlib parameters to use for point area or line width. Another way the relational functions differ from existing seaborn functionality is that they have better support for using numeric variables for hue and size semantics. This functionality may be propagated to other functions that can add a hue semantic in future versions; it has not been in this release. The lineplot function also has support for statistical estimation and is replacing the older tsplot function, which still exists but is marked for removal in a future release. lineplot is better aligned with the API of the rest of the library and more flexible in showing relationships across additional variables by modifying the size and style semantics independently. It also has substantially improved support for date and time data, a major pain factor in tsplot. The cost is that some of the more esoteric options in tsplot for representing uncertainty (e.g. a colormapped KDE of the bootstrap distribution) have not been implemented in the new function. There is quite a bit of new documentation that explains these new functions in more detail, including detailed examples of the various options in the API reference and a more verbose tutorial. These functions should be considered in a "stable beta" state. They have been thoroughly tested, but some unknown corner cases may remain to be found. The main features are in place, but not all planned functionality has been implemented. There are planned improvements to some elements, particularly the default legend, that are a little rough around the edges in this release. Finally, some of the default behavior (e.g. the default range of point/line sizes) may change somewhat in future releases. Updates to themes and palettes Several changes have been made to the seaborn style themes, context scaling, and color palettes. In general the aim of these changes was to make the seaborn styles more consistent with the style updates in matplotlib 2.0 and to leverage some of the new style parameters for better implementation of some aspects of the seaborn styles. Here is a list of the changes: Reorganized and updated some axes\_style/plotting\_context parameters to take advantage of improvements in the matplotlib 2.0 update. The biggest change involves using several new parameterss in the "style" spec while moving parameters that used to implement the corresponding aesthetics to the "context" spec. For example, axes spines and ticks are now off instead of having their width/length zeroed out for the darkgrid style. That means the width/length of these elements can now be scaled in different contexts. The effect is a more cohesive appearance of the plots, especially in larger contexts. These changes include only minimal support for the 1.x matplotlib series. Users who are stuck on matplotlib 1.5 but wish to use seaborn styling may want to use the seaborn parameters that can be accessed through the matplotlib stylesheet interface. Updated the seaborn palettes ("deep", "muted", "colorblind", etc.) to correspond with the new 10-color matplotlib default. The legacy palettes are now available at "deep6", "muted6", "colorblind6", etc. Additionally, a few individual colors were tweaked for better consistency, aesthetics, and accessibility. Calling color\_palette (or set\_palette) with a named qualitative palettes (i.e. one of the seaborn palettes, the colorbrewer qualitative palettes, or the matplotlib matplotlib tableau-derived palettes) and no specified number of colors will return all of the colors in the palette. This means that for some palettes, the returned list will have a different length than it did in previous versions. Enhanced color\_palette to accept a parameterized specification of a cubehelix palette in in a string, prefixed with "ch:" (e.g. "ch:-.1,.2,l=.7"). Note that keyword arguments can be spelled out or referenced using only their first letter. Reversing the palette is accomplished by appending "\_r", as with other matplotlib colormaps. This specification will be accepted by any seaborn function with a palette= parameter. Slightly increased the base font sizes in plotting\_context and increased the scaling factors for "talk" and "poster" contexts. Calling set will now call set\_color\_codes to re-assign the single letter color codes by default API changes A few functions have been renamed or have had changes to their default parameters. The factorplot function has been renamed to catplot. The new name ditches the original R-inflected terminology to use a name that is more consistent with terminology in pandas and in seaborn itself. This change should hopefully make catplot easier to discover, and it should make more clear what its role is. factorplot still exists and will pass its arguments through to catplot with a warning. It may be removed eventually, but the transition will be as gradual as possible. The other reason that the factorplot name was changed was to ease another alteration which is that the default kind in catplot is now "strip" (corresponding to stripplot). This plots a categorical scatter plot which is usually a much better place to start and is more consistent with the default in relplot. The old default style in factorplot ("point", corresponding to pointplot) remains available if you want to show a statistical estimation. The lvplot function has been renamed to boxenplot. The "letter-value" terminology that was used to name the original kind of plot is obscure, and the abbreviation to lv did not help anything. The new name should make the plot more discoverable by describing its format (it plots multiple boxes, also known as "boxen"). As with factorplot, the lvplot function still exists to provide a relatively smooth transition. Renamed the size parameter to height in multi-plot grid objects (FacetGrid, PairGrid, and JointGrid) along with functions that use them (factorplot, lmplot, pairplot, and jointplot) to avoid conflicts with the size parameter that is used in scatterplot and lineplot (necessary to make relplot work) and also makes the meaning of the parameter a bit more clear. Changed the default diagonal plots in pairplot to use `func`:kdeplot` when a "hue" dimension is used. Deprecated the statistical annotation component of JointGrid. The method is still available but will be removed in a future version. Two older functions that were deprecated in earlier versions, coefplot and interactplot, have undergone final removal from the code base. Documentation improvements There has been some effort put into improving the documentation. The biggest change is that the introduction to the library has been completely rewritten to provide much more information and, critically, examples. In addition to the high-level motivation, the introduction also covers some important topics that are often sources of confusion, like the distinction between figure-level and axes-level functions, how datasets should be formatted for use in seaborn, and how to customize the appearance of the plots. Other improvements have been made throughout, most notably a thorough re-write of the categorical tutorial categorical\_tutorial. Other small enhancements and bug fixes Changed rugplot to plot a matplotlib LineCollection instead of many Line2D objects, providing a big speedup for large arrays. Changed the default off-diagonal plots to use scatterplot. (Note that the "hue" currently draws three separate scatterplots instead of using the hue semantic of the scatterplot function). Changed color handling when using kdeplot with two variables. The default colormap for the 2D density now follows the color cycle, and the function can use color and label kwargs, adding more flexibility and avoiding a warning when using with multi-plot grids. Added the subplot\_kws parameter to PairGrid for more flexibility. Removed a special case in PairGrid that defaulted to drawing stacked histograms on the diagonal axes. Fixed jointplot/JointGrid and regplot so that they now accept list inputs. Fixed a bug in FacetGrid when using a single row/column level or using col\_wrap=1. Fixed functions that set axis limits so that they preserve auto-scaling state on matplotlib 2.0. Avoided an error when using matplotlib backends that cannot render a canvas (e.g. PDF). Changed the install infrastructure to explicitly declare dependencies in a way that pip is aware of. This means that pip install seaborn will now work in an empty environment. Additionally, the dependencies are specified with strict minimal versions. Updated the testing infrastructure to execute tests with pytest (although many individual tests still use nose assertion).},

  abstract = {This is a major update that is being released simultaneously with version 0.9.1. It has all of the same features (and bugs!) as 0.9.1, but there are important changes to the dependencies. Most notably, all support for Python 2 has now been dropped. Support for Python 3.5 has also been dropped. Seaborn is now strictly compatible with Python 3.6+. Minimally supported versions of the dependent PyData libraries have also been increased, in some cases substantially. While seaborn has tended to be very conservative about maintaining compatibility with older dependencies, this was causing increasing pain during development. At the same time, these libraries are now much easier to install. Going forward, seaborn will likely stay close to the Numpy community guidelines for version support. This release also removes a few previously-deprecated features: The tsplot function and seaborn.timeseries module have been removed. Recall that tsplot was replaced with lineplot. The seaborn.apionly entry-point has been removed. The seaborn.linearmodels module (previously renamed to seaborn.regression) has been removed. Looking forward Now that seaborn is a Python 3 library, it can take advantage of keyword-only arguments. It is likely that future versions will introduce this syntax, potentially in a breaking way. For guidance, most seaborn functions have a signature that looks like func(x, y, ..., data=None, **kwargs) where the **kwargs are specified in the function. Going forward it will likely be necessary to specify data and all subsequent arguments with an explicit key=value mapping. This style has long been used throughout the documentation, and the formal requirement will not be introduced until at least the next major release. Adding this feature will make it possible to enhance some older functions with more modern capabilities (e.g., adding a native hue semantic within functions like jointplot and regplot).},

  abstract = {We perform a systematic search for Galactic globular cluster (GC) stars in the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) catalogue that formed part of Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1), and identify 5 members of NGC104 (47 Tucanae), 1 member of NGC5272 (M3), 5 members of NGC6121 (M4), 7 members of NGC6397, and 2 members of NGC6656 (M22). By taking a weighted average of the member stars, fully accounting for the correlations between parameter estimates, we estimate the parallax (and, hence, distance) and proper motion (PM) of the GCs. This provides a homogeneous PM study of multiple GCs based on an astrometric catalog with small and well-controlled systematic errors, and yields random PM errors that are similar to existing measurements. Detailed comparison to the available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) measurements generally shows excellent agreement, validating the astrometric quality of both TGAS and HST. By contrast, comparison to ground-based measurements shows that some of those must have systematic errors exceeding the random errors. Our parallax estimates have uncertainties an order of magnitude larger than previous studies, but nevertheless imply distances consistent with previous estimates. By combining our PM measurements with literature positions, distances and radial velocities, we measure Galactocentric space motions for the clusters and find that these are also in good agreement with previous orbital analyses. Our results highlight the future promise of Gaia for the determining accurate distances and PMs of Galactic GCs, which will provide crucial constraints on the near end of the cosmic distance ladder, and provide accurate GC orbital histories.},

Each time a source passes within the Gaia field of view, it moves over 10 CCDs in 45 s and a lightcurve with 4.5 s sampling (the crossing time per CCD) is registered. Given that the 4.5 s sampling represents a virtually unexplored parameter space in optical time domain astronomy, this data set potentially provides a unique opportunity to open up the fast transient sky. We present a method to start mining the wealth of information in the per CCD Gaia data. We perform extensive data filtering to eliminate known on-board and data processing artefacts, and present a statistical method to identify sources that show transient brightness variations on \textasciitilde 2 hours timescales. We illustrate that by using the Gaia photometric CCD measurements, we can detect transient brightness variations down to an amplitude of 0.3 mag on timescales ranging from 15 seconds to several hours. We search an area of \textasciitilde 23.5 square degrees on the sky, and find four strong candidate fast transients. Two candidates are tentatively classified as flares on M-dwarf stars, while one is probably a flare on a giant star and one potentially a flare on a solar type star. These classifications are based on archival data and the timescales involved.

  abstract = {With the success of the Kepler and CoRoT missions, the number of stars with detected solar-like oscillations has increased by several orders of magnitude; for the first time we are able to perform large-scale ensemble asteroseismology of these stars. In preparation for this golden age of asteroseismology we have computed expected values of various asteroseismic observables from models of varying mass and metallicity. The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation, {$\increment\nu$}, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram, the epsilon diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations and early results from Kepler.},

in the sky, for which complementary techniques, such as astrometry,
asteroseismology, spectroscopy and interferometry, can be combined. The
K2 mission is providing a unique opportunity to obtain high-precision
photometric time series for bright stars along the ecliptic. However,
bright targets require a large number of pixels to capture the entirety
of the stellar flux, and CCD saturation, as well as restrictions on data
storage and bandwidth, limit the number and brightness of stars that can
be observed. To overcome this, we have developed a new photometric
technique, which we call halo photometry, to observe very bright stars
using a limited number of pixels. Halo photometry is simple, fast and
does not require extensive pixel allocation, and will allow us to use K2
and other photometric missions, such as TESS, to observe very bright
stars for asteroseismology and to search for transiting exoplanets. We
apply this method to the seven brightest stars in the Pleiades open
cluster. Each star exhibits variability; six of the stars show what are
most likely slowly pulsating B-star pulsations, with amplitudes ranging
from 20 to 2000 ppm. For the star Maia, we demonstrate the utility of
combining K2 photometry with spectroscopy and interferometry to show
that it is not a `Maia variable', and to establish that its variability
is caused by rotational modulation of a large chemical spot on a 10 d
time-scale.},

  abstract = {This dissertation deals with normal-mode vibrations of the Sun, as measured by their effect on the solar total irradiance. I have studied "5-minute" p-mode oscillations of radial order n (TURNEQ) 16 - 26 and degree l = 0 - 2 in the 1980 data from the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) on the Solar Maximum Mission satellite (SMM). The frequencies of separate (n,l) peaks in the spectrum of ACRIM data agree with those of previous observers to within ('(TURN))3 parts in 10('4). For the oscillatory peaks of highest signal quality the
frequency error is estimated to be less than one part in 10('4). Discrepancies between observed and theoretical frequencies are already much greater than discrepancies among observed frequencies. Quasi -degenerate m states, of which the (n,l) peaks are in principle
comprised, cannot be distinguished in the ACRIM power spectrum, contrary to previous claims. The mean amplitudes of individual (n,l) peaks have been established with 10 - 20\% accuracy; r.m.s. fractional irradiance variations of up to 3 parts per million occur. The observed amplitude ratio of 5-min modes in velocity and intensity agrees roughly with preliminary theoretical estimates, but more theory and observation are required. The 5-min oscillation data from the ACRIM have been
interpreted in terms of a theoretically motivated picture in which the modes behave like independently and randomly excited harmonic
oscillators. The relative frequency width of the most prominent l = 0 modes is about one part in 2000, implying an oscillator time constant (e-folding time for energy decay) of 1 to 2 days. This lifetime is approximately confirmed by direct observations of amplitude variations in these modes. The lifetime of these modes was previously a matter of controversy. Solar rotation will split the m states belonging to a given (n,l) multiplet, making the l {$>$} 1 peaks broader than they would
otherwise be. From the widths of the l = 1 peaks I deduce an upper limit on the separation of adjacent m states of 1.0 (mu)Hz with ('(TURN))99\% confidence. This is 2.2 times the splitting that solid-body rotation at the observed ('(TURN))1/25-day sidereal equatorial surface rate would imply. . . . (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

The eMSTOs are also found in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of young-age star clusters. The origin of the eMSTOs is still an open question. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting parameter \$\textbackslash delta\_\{\textbackslash rm ov\}\$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars with an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of star clusters may be affected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC).

Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch (RGB) and helium-core-burning (HeB) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed \{{$\nu$} \}\textsubscript{\textbackslash max }, which might hold clues for understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE and LAMOST.},

Here, we perform asteroseismic analyses on LPVs observed by the 4-year Kepler mission. Using a cross-correlation method, we detect unambiguous pulsation ridges associated with radial fundamental modes (n = 1) and overtones (n 2), where the radial order assignment is made by using theoretical frequencies and observed frequencies. Our results confirm that the amplitude variability seen in semiregulars is consistent with oscillations being solar-like. We identify that the dipole modes, l = 1, are dominant in the radial orders of 3 {$\leq$} n {$\leq$} 6, and that quadrupole modes, l = 2, are dominant in the first overtone n = 2. A test of seismic scaling relations using Gaia DR2 parallaxes reveals the possibility that the relations break down when {$\nu$}max 3 \textmu Hz (R 40 R , or log L/L 2.6). Our homogeneous measurements of pulsation amplitude and period for 3213 LPVs will be very valuable for probing effects of pulsation on mass loss, in particular in those stars with periods around 60 days, which has been argued as a threshold of substantial pulsation-triggered mass loss.},

The measurements, together with the E(B - V) values given by Schlegel et al., allow us to derive the observed, model-free reddening coefficients for these colours. The results are compared with previous measurements and with the predictions of various Galactic reddening laws. We find that (i) the dust reddening map of Schlegel et al. overestimates E(B - V) by about 14 per cent, consistent with the recent work of Schlafly et al. and Schlafly \&amp; Finkbeiner; (ii) after accounting for the differences in reddening normalization, the newly deduced reddening coefficients for colours FUV - NUV, NUV - u, u - g, g - r, r - i, i - z, z - J, J - H and H - Ks differ by respectively -1640, 15.5, 12.6, -0.8, 3.4, -0.7, 3.5, 2.5 and 1.4 per cent from the predictions of the Fitzpatrick reddening law for an assumed total-to-selective extinction ratio R(V) = 3.1, and by respectively -1730, 13.0 , 8.1, 10.0, 8.0, -13.5, -1.7, -6.7 and -17.1 per cent from the predictions of the CCM reddening law; and (iii) all the new reddening coefficients, except those for NUV - u and u - g, favour the R(V) = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law over the R(V) = 3.1 CCM and O'Donnell reddening laws. Using the Ks-band extinction coefficient predicted by the R(V) = 3.1 Fitzpatrick law and the observed reddening coefficients, we deduce new extinction coefficients for the FUV, NUV, u, g, r, i, z, J, H, W1 and W2 passbands. We recommend that the new reddening and extinction coefficients should be used in the future and that the Fitzpatrick reddening law in the UV should probably be updated. We stress, however, that the FUV- and NUV-band coefficients should be used with caution, given their relatively large measurement uncertainties. Finally, potential applications of the `standard pair' technique with the upcoming LAMOST Galactic surveys are discussed.},

Systematics due to temperature, bolometric correction, extinction, asteroseismic radius, and the spatially-correlated \$\{\textbackslash it Gaia\}\$ parallax zero-point, contribute to a \$2\textbackslash\%\$ systematic uncertainty on the \$\{\textbackslash it Gaia\}\$-asteroseismic radius agreement. We find that dwarf and giant scaling radii are on a parallactic scale at the \$-2.1 \textbackslash\% \textbackslash pm 0.5 \textbackslash\% \{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash{} (rand.)\} \textbackslash pm 2.0\textbackslash\% \{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash{} (syst.)\}\$ level (dwarfs) and \$+1.7\textbackslash\% \textbackslash pm 0.3\textbackslash\% \{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash{} (rand.)\} \textbackslash pm 2.0\textbackslash\% \{\textbackslash rm (syst.)\}\$ level (giants), supporting the accuracy and precision of scaling relations in this domain. In total, the \$2\textbackslash\%\$ agreement that we find holds for stars spanning radii between \$0.8R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$30 R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We do, however, see evidence for \$\textbackslash textit\{relative\}\$ errors in scaling radii between dwarfs and giants at the \$4\textbackslash\% \textbackslash pm 0.6\textbackslash\%\$ level, and find evidence of departures from simple scaling relations for radii above \$30 R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Asteroseismic masses for very metal-poor stars are still overestimated relative to astrophysical priors, but at a reduced level. We see no trend with metallicity in radius agreement for stars with \$-0.5 \&lt;\$ [Fe/H] \$\&lt; +0.5\$. We quantify the spatially-correlated parallax errors in the \$\{\textbackslash it Kepler\}\$ field, which globally agree with the \$\{\textbackslash it Gaia\}\$ team's published covariance model. We provide \$\{\textbackslash it Gaia\}\$ radii, corrected for extinction and the \$\{\textbackslash it Gaia\}\$ parallax zero-point for our full sample of \$\textbackslash sim 3900\$ stars, including dwarfs, subgiants, and first-ascent giants.},

  abstract = {Photometric time series of the \$\textbackslash gamma\$ Dor star 43 Cyg obtained with the BRITE-Constellation nano-satellites allow us to study its pulsational properties in detail and to constrain its interior structure. We aim to find a g-mode period spacing pattern that allows us to determine the near-core rotation rate of 43 Cyg and redetermine the star's fundamental atmospheric parameters and chemical composition. We conducted a frequency analysis using the 156-days long data set obtained with the BRITE-Toronto satellite and employed a suite of MESA/GYRE models to derive the mode identification, asymptotic period spacing and near-core rotation rate. We also used high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopic data obtained at the 1.2m Mercator telescope with the HERMES spectrograph to redetermine the fundamental atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of 43 Cyg using the software Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME). We detected 43 intrinsic pulsation frequencies and identified 18 of them to be part of a period spacing pattern consisting of prograde dipole modes with an asymptotic period spacing \$\textbackslash Delta \textbackslash Pi\_\{l=1\}\$ of \$2970\^\{+700\}\_\{-570\} \textbackslash rm s\$. The near-core rotation rate was determined to be \$f\_\{\textbackslash rm rot\} = 0.56\^\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.14\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash rm d\^\{-1\}\$. The atmosphere of 43 Cyg shows solar chemical composition at an effective temperature of 7150 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 150 K, a log g of 4.2 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.6 dex and a projected rotational velocity, \$v \{\textbackslash rm sin\}i\$, of 44 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 4 kms\$\^\{-1\}\$. The morphology of the observed period spacing patterns shows indications of the presence of a significant chemical gradient in the stellar interior.},
